.SH NAME
.B putq, lis_putq
\- puts a message on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int putq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to which the put the message.
.TP
.I mp
the message to put.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putq ()
places the message pointed to by
.I mp
on the queue
.I q
without invoking the queue's put procedure.
.PP
After placing the message on queue
.IR q ,
.BR putq ()
adjusts the queue's flags and byte counts appropriately and schedules the
queue for processing by
.BR runqueues ()
if necessary.
.PP
It is the responsibility of a procedure calling
.BR putq ()
with a low priority message pointed to by
.I mp
to first call
.BR canput (9)
for the queue to check for flow control.
If
.BR canput (9)
fails for queue
.IR q ,
the procedure should not normally invoke
.BR putq ()
with a low priority message for the flow controlled queue
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putq ()
returns true (1) and places the message pointed to by
.I mp
on the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putq ()
returns false (0) and
does not alter the passed in queue or message.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR putq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR putq ()
fails when the following occurs:
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
the structure pointed to by
.I q
is not a queue structure;
the queue pointed to by
.I q
is closing, or the queue has had put and service routine processing turned off
(e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
.BR putq ()
called on a queue frozen by
.BR freezestr (9)
will result in single-party deadlock.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putq ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It can be guaranteed that
.BR putq ()
will always succeed, even for banded messages, by calling
.BR strqset (9)
to set the high and low water marks and packet sizes for all bands used by the
driver or module.
.PP
When
.BR putq ()
fails and returns zero (0), it is the callers responsibility to address the
disposition of the passed in message,
.IR mp .
A typical response would be to free the message using
.BR freemsg (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR canput (9),
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR putnext (9),
.BR getq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Versions of
.BR putq ()
previous to OpenSS7 release
.BR LiS-2.16.18-17
automatically freed the message on failure.
.PP
Versions of
.BR putq ()
after OpenSS7 release
.BR LiS-2.16.18-16
do not free the message on failure in accordance with SVR 4.2 and other
implementation documentation.
.PP
.BR putq ()
still has bugs related to
.BR qprocsoff (9)
handling in that it fails while
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is in effect or if the stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR putq ()
is compatible with 
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following porting considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR putq ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR putq ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR putq ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
