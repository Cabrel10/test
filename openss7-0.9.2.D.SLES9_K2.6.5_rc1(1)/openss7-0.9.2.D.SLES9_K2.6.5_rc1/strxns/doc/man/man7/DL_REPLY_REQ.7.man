.SH NAME
.B DL_REPLY_REQ (dl_reply_req_t)
\- this request primitive is passed to the DLS Provider by the DLS User

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B DL_REPLY_REQ
is passed to the DLS Provider by the DLS User to request that a DLSDU
be returned from a peer DLS Provider or that DLSDUs be exchanged between
stations using acknowledged connectionless mode data unit exchange
procedures.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.B DL_REPLY_REQ
.TP
.I dl_correlation
conveys a unique identifier which will be returned in the
.BR DL_REPLY_STATUS_IND (7)
primitive to allow the DLS User to correlate the status to the
appropriate
.B DL_REPLY_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys the length of the
.I DLSAP
address of the destination DLS User. If the
destination user is implemented using DLPI, this address is the full
.I DLSAP
address returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the destination
.I DLSAP
address begins.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_length
conveys the length of the
.I DLSAP
address of the source DLS User.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the source
.I DLSAP
address begins.
.TP
.I dl_priority
priority provided for the data unit transmission.
.TP
.I dl_service_class
specifies whether or not an acknowledge capability in the medium access
control sublayer is to be used for the data unit transmission.
.SH STATE
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
If the request is erroneous, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned, and the resulting state is unchanged. If the message is valid, a
.BR DL_REPLY_STATUS_IND (7)
is returned. This will indicate the success or failure of the previous
associated acknowledged connectionless-mode data unit exchange.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The destination
.I DLSAP
address was in an incorrect format or contained invalid information.
.TP
.B DL_BADDATA
The amount of data in the current
.I DLSDU
exceeded the DLS provider's
.I DLSDU
limit.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is valid, but not supported.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_UNSUPPORTED
Requested service not supported by Provider (Request with response at the
.I Medium Access Control
sublayer).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.

.SH CONFORMANCE
