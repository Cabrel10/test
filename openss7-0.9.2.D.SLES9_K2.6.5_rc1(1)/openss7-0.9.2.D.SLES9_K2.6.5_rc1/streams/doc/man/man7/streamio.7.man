.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I STREAMS
I/O control commands are ioctl commands that are defined to operate on
all
.I STREAMS
character special devices.  All of these commands are interpreted
by the stream head.  Some commands are passed to the
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.PP
.I STREAMS
I/O control commands are invoked using the normal
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call, but are defined only for
.I STREAMS
character special files.
.TP
.I fd
is an open file descriptor for a
.I STREAMS
character special file.
.TP
.I command
is the
.I STREAMS
I/O control function that the caller requests be performed.
.TP
.I arg
provides additional information required by the particular I/O
.IR command .
Specific
.IR command " and " arg
are described below.

.SS I_ATMARK
.PP
Checks whether the next messages on the stream head read queue is marked.
.I arg
is an integer value indicating which messages to check as follows:
.TP
.B ANYMARK
check whether the next message on the stream head read queue is marked.
.TP
.B LASTMARK
check whether the next message on the stream head read queue is the last
marked message (i.e. it is not followed by a another marked message).
.PP
Marked messages are messages that have the
.B MSGMARK
flag set in the message
.I b_flag
field.
.PP
Upon success,
.I I_ATMARK
returns (0) to indicate that the stream head read queue does not meet the
mark criteria, or (1) to indicate that it meets the mark criteria.
Upon failure,
.I I_ATMARK
returns -1 and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I arg
is invalid.
.PP
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
also uses the
.B MSGNEXTMARK
and
.B MSGNOTNEXTMARK
flags on the message blocks; but their use is undocumented.
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
indicates that it is permissible for
.I arg
to be the inclusive OR of the
.B ANYMARK
and
.B LASTMARK
flags.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxdoc
.]
indicates that if both
.B ANYMARK
and
.B LASTMARK
are set,
.B ANYMARK
supersedes
.BR LASTMARK .
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
indicates that the bitwise-OR of
.B ANYMARK
and
.B LASTMARK
is allowed and that, if both are set,
.B ANYMARK
supersedes
.BR LASTMARK .

.SS I_CANPUT
.PP
Checks whether messages can be written to the queue band specified by
.IR arg .
.I arg
is an integer which contains the queue band to test for flow control.
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
adds the extension that
.I arg
can also be one of the following values:
.TP
.B ANYBAND
instead of testing a specified band, tests whether any (existing) band is writable.
.PP
Upon success,
.I retval
is false (0) if the queue band
.I arg
is flow controlled,
true (1) if the queue band is not flow controlled.
Upon failure,
.I retval
is -1 and
.IR errno (3)
is set to one of the following errors numbers:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I arg
is outside the range 0 to 255 and does not represent a valid priority band.
.PP
Any of the errors returned by
.BR putpmsg (2s)
may be returned in
.IR errno .
Any error received in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message indicating a write error for the stream will be returned in
.IR errno .

.SS I_CKBAND
.PP
Checks whether messages can be read from the queue band specified by
.IR arg .
.I arg
is an integer which contains the queue band to test for an available message.
Upon success,
.B I_CKBAND
returns false (0) if there is no message for the specified queue band
.I arg
available, and true (1) if a message for the specified queue band
.I arg
is available to be read with
.BR read "(2) or " getmsg (2).
Upon failure,
.B I_CKBAND
returns -1 and

is set to one of the following error numbers:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I arg
contains a priority band outside the range 0 - 255.

.SS I_FDINSERT
.PP
This command performs similar to
.BR putmsg (2),
however, it performs the additional function of inserting the bottom read queue
pointer associated with a specified file descriptor in the resulting message.
This ioctl is often used to accepting incoming connections on
.BR tpi (7)
based protocols.
.PP
.I arg
is a pointer to a
.B strfdinsert
structure that is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct strfdinsert {
    struct strbuf ctlbuf;
    struct strbuf databuf;
    ulong flags;
    int fildes;
    int offset;
};
\s+1\fR
.fi
.TP
.I ctlbuf
describes the control part of the message, and is formated the same as the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I ctlptr
as an argument to
.BR putmsg (2).
The
.I len
field of this
.B strbuf
structure must be large enough to accept the translated file descriptor.
Unlike
.BR putmsg (2)
this message must contain a control part.
.TP
.I databuf
describes the data part of the message, formatted the same as the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I datptr
as an argument to
.BR putmsg (2).
Unlike
.BR putmsg (2)
if the
.I len
field of this
.B strbuf
structure is zero, it indicates that no data part is to be sent with the
message.
(For
.BR putmsg (2),
a
.I len
field of zero (0) would indicate to send a zero-length data part message.)
.TP
.I flags
provides the options flags formatted the same as the
.I flags
argument to
.BR putmsg (2).
.TP
.I fildes
is the file descriptor of a stream to be translated to a read queue pointer and
placed into the control part of the message.
.TP
.I offset
is the offset into the control part to place the read queue pointer associated
with
.IR fildes .
This
.I offset
must leave sufficient room in the control part of the message to permit the
read queue pointer to be overwritten without exceeding the bounds of the
control part.
.PP
Upon success,
.B I_FDINSERT
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.B I_FDINSERT
returns -1 and sets
.IR errno (3)
to one of the following error numbers:
.\"
.\"
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
.IR arg ", " ctlbuf ", " databuf ", " ctlbuf.buf " or " databuf.buf
points outside the caller's valid address space.

.SS I_FIND
.PP
Checks whether the specified module is currently present in the stream
specified by
.IR fd .
.PP
.I arg
is a pointer to a string which provides the name of the module to find.
.PP
Upon success,
.B I_FIND
returns true (1) if the module is present in the stream under the name
.IR arg ,
and returns false (0) if the module is not present in the stream.
Upon failure,
.B I_FIND
returns -1 and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
.I arg
points to a string which exceeds the callers valid address space.
.\"
.\"
.SS I_FLUSHBAND
.PP
Flushes the stream for a specified band.
.I arg
points to a
.B bandinfo
structure formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct bandinfo {
	unsigned char bi_pri;
	int bi_flag;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
.I bi_pri
specifies the priority of the band to flush.
.I bi_flag
specifies which queues to flush and has one of the following values:
.TP
.B FLUSHR
flush the read queues.
.TP
.B FLUSHW
flush the write queues.
.TP
.B FLUSHRW
flush the read and write queues.
.PP
Note that on a bare
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4),
specifying
.B FLUSHR
will flush the read queues at both ends of the pipe, and
.B FLUSHW
will flush the write queues at both ends of the pipe.
.BR FLUSHRW
will still flush both queues.  This is expected behaviour for bare
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes (that is, pipes that have no modules pushed on either end).  For the
.B I_FLUSH
command to flush the proper queues in modules pushed on a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe,
.BR pipemod (4)
must be pushed onto one end of the pipe before pushing any other modules.  Pushing
.BR pipemod (4)
will also reverse the effect that
.BR FLUSHR " and " FLUSHW
have on the opposite STREAM head:
.B FLUSHR
flushes the near read queue and the far write queue,
.B FLUSHW
flushes the near write queue and the far read queue.  See
.BR pipemod (4)
for details.
.PP
Upon success,
.B I_FLUSHBAND
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.B I_FLUSHBAND
returns -1 and sets

call when called for
.IR fd .
.I arg
is an integer value containing the read options flags which may be one flag
from the mode group as follows:
.TP
.B RNORM
byte-stream mode.  This is the default read mode.
This is the normal byte-stream mode where message boundaries are ignored.
.BR read (2s)
and
.BR readv (2s)
returns data until the read count has been satisfied or a zero length message
is received.
.TP
.B RMSGN
message non-discard mode.
The

will return when either the count is satisfied, a zero length message is
received, or a message boundary is encountered.  If there is any data left in
a message after the read count has been satisfied, the message is placed back
on the stream head read queue.  The data will be read on a subsequent

.B RMSGD
message discard mode.
Similar to
.B RMSGN
mode, above, but data that remains in a message after the read count has been
satisfied is discarded.
.TP
.B RFILL
message fill mode.
Similar to

module requiring the use of the
.BR tirdwr (4)
module for use with the
.BR xti (3)
library.
