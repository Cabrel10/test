.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "int pcmsg(unsigned char " type ");
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I type
The message type to test for priority control.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
is a multiprocessor version of testing the
.I db_type
field for priority in a
.BR datab (9)
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
is used on multiprocessor systems where
.I db_type
would be tested against
.B QPCTL
(see
.BR datab (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
returns true (1) if
.I type
is of a priority message type;
it returns false (0) if
.I type 
is of a normal message type.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although
.BR pcmsg ()
is less architecture dependent way to testing
.I db_type
for a priority message, and it is often shown in favour of \fC(type >=
QPCTL)\fR for MP systems, it is rather unclear what advantage a multiprocessor
implementation can gain from this function.  Perhaps it was intended to
protect dereferencing of the
.B mp->b_datap
pointer, but its argument does not do that.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
is implemented, perhaps not surprisingly, as (effectively) \fC(type >= QPCTL)\fP.  Following is the
precise implementation:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
__EXTERN_INLINE int pcmsg(unsigned char type)
{
    return ((type & QPCTL) != 0);
}
\s+1\fP

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR pcmsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ;
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR IRIX \(rg,

.I SVR 4.2 MP
functions.
.[
aixdoc

.[
osfdoc
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
documents the
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function
.BR queclass (9)
which performs a similar function, but does not document
.BR pcmsg ().
.[
soldoc
.]
.I LiS
does not provide
.BR pcmsg ()
or
.BR queclass (9).
.[
lis
.]
.BR pcmsg ()
is not as widely implemented as one would like and it appears that there is no advantage to using
.BR pcmsg ()
over testing against
.BR QPCTL .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will test
.I b_datap->db_type
against
.B QPCTL
rather than calling
.BR pcmsg ().
.IP \(em
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
shows constructs like this: (although the advantage of this is unknown \- see above under
.RI \*(lq NOTICES \*(rq)
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
#ifdef MT
    if (pcmsg(bp->b_datap->db_type))
        putnext(q, bp);
#else
    if (bp->b_datap->db_type >= QPCTL)
        putnext(q, bp);

.RE
.IP \(em
.BR pcmsg ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR pcmsg ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR pcmsg ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
