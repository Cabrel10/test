@c This file is include from install.texi and contains the descriptions for
@c package-specific enable/disable and with/without options

In addition, the following @command{configure} options, specific to the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE}
package are available:

@table @command
@item --enable-user-mode
@opindex user-mode
Enable user mode build.  The option defaults to @samp{disabled}.  Don't use this option, it hasn't
been tested.

@item --enable-broken-cpu-flags
@opindex broken-cpu-flags
Specify @code{int} instead of @code{long} interrupt flags.  Linux uses @code{long} interrupt flags
exclusively.  The default is to use @code{long} interrupt flags.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --disable-lis-development
@opindex lis-development
This option is new to @cite{LiS-2.18.2}.
Disable reporting of source code path traces in debug logs.  @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} passes file name
and line number arguments to many of the exported functions.  This is exhaustive of stack resources
and requires the passing of more than three arguments on the stack in many circumnstances.  Note
that disabling code path traces breaks binary compatibility.  The default is perform source code
path traces, unless optimized for size or speed, in which case, the default is to not perform source
code path traces.  This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --enable-k-timers
@opindex k-timers
Invoke Linux kernel cahcing on timer structures.  This increases speed and efficiency but is unsafe
on SMP architectures and for buggy or high-speed drivers.  The default is to @strong{not} perform
kernel caching on timer structures.  This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-k-cache
@opindex k-cache
Invoke Linux kernel caching on primary structures.  This incresase speed and efficiency.  The
default is to @strong{not} perform kernel caching on primary structures.  This option defaults to
@samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-atomic-stats
@opindex atomic-stats
Enable atomic statistics elements for STREAMS statistics.  The changes STREAMS statistics elements
from the standard @code{int} to @code{atomic_t} to permit atomic increment of statistics structures.
This is not recommended and the default is to @strong{not} use @code{atomic_t} for statistics
structures.  This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --with-lis-regparms=NUMBER
@itemx --without-lis-regparms
@opindex lis-regparms
This option is new to @cite{LiS-2.18.2}.
Specifies the number of parameters to pass in registers to @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} exported functions.
Specifying other than @samp{0} here may break binary compatibility.  Specifying
@samp{--without-lis-regparms} will default to the number used for kernel exported functions.
Specifying greater than @samp{3} will cause the build to fail.  The default is to pass no arguments
in registers.  This option defaults to @samp{0}.

@item --without-solaris-consts
@opindex solaris-consts
Attempt to be compatible with Solaris constants.  The default is to attempt to be compatible with
Solaris constants.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --without-solaris-cmn_err
@opindex solaris-cmn_err
Specifies whether Solaris-style @code{cmn_err} is used.  The Solaris style prints a newline at the
end of each statement.  The SVR 4.2 style prints a newline at the beginning of each statement unless
@code{CE_CONT} is specified.  Linux kernel logs use the former, so this defaults to Solaris-style.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
