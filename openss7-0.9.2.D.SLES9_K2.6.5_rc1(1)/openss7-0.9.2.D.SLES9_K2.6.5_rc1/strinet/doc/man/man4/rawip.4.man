.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B RAWIP
is an implementation of the Internet Protocol
.RB ( IP )
defined in RFC 791.
.[
rfc791
.]
.[
rfc1349
.]
.[
rfc2474
.]
.[
rfc3168
.]
.[
rfc3260
.]
It implements a connectionless, unreliable datagram packet service.  Packets may be reordered or
duplicated before they arrive.
.B RAWIP
generates and checks checksums to catch transmission errors.
.PP
.B RAWIP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
pseudo-device driver using the
.BR INET (4)
.B @PACKAGE@
package for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS\c
.
.[
LfS
.]
The
.B @PACKAGE@
package translates Linux native
.BR raw (7)
sockets into TPI
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
transport provider Streams suitable for use with XTI,
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
(see
.BR xti (3)).
.PP
.B RAWIP2
(the second generation IP driver) differs from
.B RAWIP
largely in internal implementation.
.B RAWIP2
accesses the IP layer of
.B Linux
directly, rather than opening a socket internal to the kernel.
.PP
.B RAWIP
provides one connectionless TPI Stream type.  To select the Stream,
.I raw_device
can be one of the following:
.TP
.IR /dev/rawip ", " /dev/inet/rawip ", " /dev/streams/inet/rawip .
This device provides the
.B RAWIP
protocol services using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider Interface.
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR tpi (7),
used for Internet Protocol, as described in
.BR tpi_ip (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a Stream opening this device is suitable for use with the
.BR xnet (3)
or
.BR xti (3)
library and provides
.BR RAWIP
interface using XTI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
as described in
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.IR /dev/rawip2 ", " /dev/streams/rawip .
The same as above, but accesses the second generation
.B RAWIP2
driver instead of the
.B UDP
driver.
.PP
.B RAWIP
provides one socket type for use by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (7)
calls.
.B RAWIP
provides sockets in the protocol families
.BR PF_INET " and " PF_INET6
using the protocol number
.BR IPPROTO_IP .
The
.I socket_type
can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_RAW
A standard
.I SOCK_RAW
socket that preserves message boundaries, does not Nagle, and provides only
unordered and unreliable delivery in a connectionless association.  This
socket uses the underlying Linux socket implementation,
.BR raw (7)
directly.  See
.BR raw (7)
for more information.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B RAWIP
has several implementations.  This manpage is for the
.BR INET (4)
implementation that provides
.BR tpi (7)
access to the Linux NET4 version of
.BR RAWIP .
For more information on the Linux NET4 version, see
.BR raw (7).

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
There are now two
.I STREAMS
implementations for
.BR rawip :
.B RAWIP
and
.BR RAWIP2 .
These implementations differ as follows:
.TP
.B RAWIP
This implementation is part of the
.B streams-inet
driver in the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.
The
.B streams-inet
driver implements
.I rawip
by opening a
.B Linux
.I rawip
socket internal to kernel and providing a TPI
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
interface to that socket.  This approach has been termed
.B xtios
(XTI over Sockets).
The approach is rather inefficient in that two layers of interface code are
executed.  Also, sockets does not have the same capabilities that
.I STREAMS
does in many regards, particularly internal to the kernel.  The approach is
not only inefficient, but is less usable by other
.I STREAMS
modules and multiplexing drivers.
.TP
.B RAWIP2
This implementation if part of the
.B streams-rawip
driver in the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.  This implementation uses the direct approach of hooking into the
.B Linux
kernel at the
.BR ip (7)
level, using direct function calls, and does not open a socket.  This approach
is more efficient in that only
.I STREAMS
interface code is invoked in the data path.
.PP
The
.B RAWIP
implementation is the traditional one for the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.
.B RAWIP2
was an afterthought.
One of the reasons for implementing a separate
.B RAWIP2
driver was to be able to do performance comparisons between the two
approaches.  Also, using the
.B RAWIP2
driver, it is possible to make fair performance (throughput, latency, CPU
occupancy) comparisons between the NET4 Linux sockets implementation of
.I rawip
and the
.I STREAMS
implementation.
It was intended that the
.BR netperf (1)
package be used to provide performance histogram comparisons between the two
implementations.
.PP
It may seem like a lot of trouble to go to, however, lkml (Linux Kernel
Mailing List) has made some very strong (and unsupported in the author's
opinion) statements regarding the performance of
.I STREAMS
and that of sockets for Internet protocols.  Performance tests of this nature
could dis-spell those rumours.
