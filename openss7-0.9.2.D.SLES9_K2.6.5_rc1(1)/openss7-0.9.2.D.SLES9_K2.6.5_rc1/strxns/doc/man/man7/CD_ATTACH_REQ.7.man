.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that
the requesting stream be attached to the physical device indicated by the
Physical Point of Attachment (PPA).
.PP
When a Style 2 CDI stream is first opened, it is opened in the
.BR CD_UNATTACHED
state and is not associated with a Physical Point of Appearance (PPA).  The
.B CD_ATTACH_REQ
primitive requests that the provider associated the stream with the specified
PPA and move the stream to the
.B CD_DISABLED
state.
.PP
Style 1 CDI streams open in the
.BR CD_DISABLED
state, and a
.B CD_ATTACH_REQ
primitive issued on a Style 1 stream will fail.
.PP
This primitive is only valid for devices that return
.B CD_STYLE2
in the
.I cd_ppa_style
field in a
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7).
.SS Addressing
.PP
A Physical Point of Appearance corresponds to the hardware interface
associated with a specific communications device.  A PPA number is associated
with each hardware interface for a specific provider or device.
PPA numbers are are a
.BR cd_ulong ,
but which PPA number corresponds to which Physical Point of Appearance is a
provider-specific configuration matter.
Specific providers should document the mapping of PPA numbers to actual
Physical Points of Appearance as part of the provider-specific documentation.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_ppa
Specifies the Physical Point of Attachment (PPA).  The format of this field is
provider- and device-specific.
.SS State
This primitive is only valid in state
.BR CD_UNATTACHED .
The new state is
.BR CD_DISABLED .
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the provider to return an acknowledgment indicating
the success or failure of the
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ .
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When successful, the provider responds with a
.BR CD_OK_ACK (7)
primitive acknowledging successful processing of the
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ .
The new state is
.BR CD_DISABLED .
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider responds with a
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
indicating the non-fatal error.
The state is unchanged.
