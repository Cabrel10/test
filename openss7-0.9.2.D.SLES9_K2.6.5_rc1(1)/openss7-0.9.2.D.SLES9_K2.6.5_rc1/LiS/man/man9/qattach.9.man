.SH NAME
.B qattach, lis_qattach
\- attach a module onto a \fISTREAMS\fR file.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int lis_qattach(stdata_t *" head ", struct streamtab *" info ", dev_t *" devp ", cred_t *" credp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I head
the stream head to attach.
.TP
.I info
the stream table describing the module to attach to the stream head.
.TP
.I devp
a pointer to the device number to be passed to the module's qopen procedure.
.TP
.I credp
the credentials of the caller.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is called when the
.B I_PUSH
command is issued to a
.I STREAMS
character special file.  See
.BR streamio (2)
for more informaiton on
.BR I_PUSH .
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is responsible for allocating a queue pair with
.BR allocq (9),
linking the queues into the stream,
and calling the module's
.BR qopen (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR lis_attach ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR lis_attach ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR lis_attach ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP 12
.RB [ EIO ]
there is no queue associated with the stream
.IR head .
.TP 12
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
could not allocate a queue pair with
.BR allocq (9).
.PP
In addition, any error returned by the module's
.BR qopen (9)
function can be returned by
.BR qattach ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qattach ()
should only be called from user context or from within a
.BR qopen ()
or
.BR qclose ()
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
module or driver writer.

.BR qattach ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
module or driver writer.
.BR qattach ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.BR qattach ()
is highly implementation dependent in function an prototype.  Use of this
function by a driver or module will guarantee that it is not portable even between
releases of
.IR LiS .

.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
version of this function does not have the same declaration as the SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
do not export this function.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .

.BR qattach ()
is compliant with the description of the internal
.BR qattach ()
function of SVR 4

.]
as described in
.IR "\*(lqThe Magic Garden\*(rq" .

.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR qattach ()
first appeared (as an internal function) in SVR 3.

.BR lis_qattach ()
is no longer an exported function as of LiS-2.18.0.
