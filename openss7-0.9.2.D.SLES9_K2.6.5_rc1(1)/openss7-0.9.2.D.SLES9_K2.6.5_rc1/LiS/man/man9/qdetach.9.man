.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the read queue of the queue pair to detach.
.TP
.I do_close
a flag indicating whether close should be performed.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qdetach ()
is called when the
.B I_POP
command is issued to a
.I STREAMS
character special file.  See
.BR streamio (2)
for more information on
.BR I_POP .
.PP
.BR qdetach ()
is responsible for calling the module's
.BR qclose (9)
routine, unlinking the queue pair from the stream, and calling
.BR freeq (9)
to deallocate the queue pair.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR lis_qdetach ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS

.BR qdetach ()
should only be called from user context or from within a
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedure.

.SH BUGS
.PP
The
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
version of this function does not have the same declaration as the SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.BR qdetach ()
is compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
do not export this function.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
LfS
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
.BR qdetach ()
is consistent with the description of the internal
.BR qdetach ()
function of
SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
as described in
.IR "\*(lqThe Magic Garden\*(rq" .
.[
magic
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR qdetach ()
first appeared in SVR 3.
.[
