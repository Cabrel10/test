.SH NAME
.B CD_WRITE_READ_REQ
\- write/read request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks.
The
.B M_PROTO
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
.\"/*
.\" * CD_WRITE_READ_REQ, M_PROTO type
.\" */
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_unitdata_req_t cd_unitdata_req;
    cd_read_req_t cd_read_req;
} cd_write_read_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the provided data be transmitted
and that the output section be disabled and the intput section enabled
immediately following the transmission.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_unitdata_req
Specifies a
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive.  See
.BR cd_unitdata_req_t (7)
for formatting of this parameter.
.TP
.I cd_read_req
Specifies a
.BR CD_READ_REQ (7)
primitive.  See
.BR cd_read_req_t (7)
for formatting of this parameter.
.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state where the
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive and
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ (7)
primitives are permitted.
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the same repsonse from the CD provider as if a
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive immediately followed by a
.BR CD_READ_REQ (7)
primitive were to be issued.
.PP
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
When unsuccessful, this primitive requires an error acknowledgement using the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive with the error indicated.
