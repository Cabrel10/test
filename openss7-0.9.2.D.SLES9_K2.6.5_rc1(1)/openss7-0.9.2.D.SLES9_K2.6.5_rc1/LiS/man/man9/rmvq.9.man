.SH NAME

\- remove a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void rmvq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to remove the message.
.TP 
.I mp
the message to remove.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
removes the message pointed to by
.I mp
from the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
The message can be removed from the middle of the queue and does not need to
be at the head or tail of the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
silently fails if
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q
is closing;
.I q
has put and service procedures turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9));
the message pointed to by
.I mp
does not exist on the queue
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
can be called from any context including user context, queue procedures,
callouts, callbacks and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is not MP-safe.
.BR rmvq ()
would be MP-safe, if the caller could ensure exclusive access to the passed in
message,
.IR mp ,
and queue,
.IR q .
.PP
On uniprocessor systems it may be sufficient to block interrupts to ensure
exclusive access to queue,
.IR q .
Ensuring exclusive access to the passed in message,
.IR mp ,
is difficult on SMP systems, because
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq "(9) and
.BR insq (9)
can change
.I mp->b_next
and
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband "(9) and
.BR rmvq (9)
can change
.IR mp ,
(e.g. remove it from the queue).
.PP
Normally exclusive access to the passed in queue,
.IR q ,
on both UP and SMP systems can be ensured most easily by freezing the stream
associated with the queue,
.IR q ,
using
.BR freezestr (9).
Otherwise, it is also possible to ensure exclusive access with
.BR MPSTR_STRLOCK (),
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK (),
.BR qwriter (),
.BR streams_put (),
or with appropriate synchronization boundaries
.RB ( STR_PERQUEUE " or " D_MTPERQ ).
However,
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
only has a broken
.BR freezestr (9),
subsequent to version 2.18.0,
and the other facilities mentioned are not implemented in
.IR LiS .
.[
LiS
.]
This makes
.BR rmvq ()
unusable on MP systems in
.IR LiS .
.[
LiS
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
does not maintain a pointer in the
.B msgb
structure to the queue to which a given message currently belongs.  This means
that
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
must search the queue pointed to by
.I q
for the message pointed to by
.I mp
using a linear search.
This is inefficient if
.BR rmvq ()
is called often by a
.I STREAMS
module or driver.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
has no known bugs aside from problems with MP-safety.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR rmvq ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI

.IP \(em
.I LiS
does not maintain a pointer in the
.BR msgb (9)
structure to the queue to which a given message currently belongs.  This means
that

using a linear search.  This is inefficient if

module or driver.

.IR UnixWare \(rg

and
