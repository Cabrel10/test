/*
 *  This file is intended to address the different situations for which
 *  MODGET/MODPUT (i.e., increment/decrement loadable kernel module use
 *  reference counts) might be needed.
 *
 *  There are basically these kinds of C source files that might have a
 *  need:
 *  - head/linux-mdep.c - includes <linux/module.h> for the head, and
 *    thus effectively defines streams.o as a module.
 *  - head/head.c - doesn't include <linux/module.h>, but will be linked
 *    into the same streams.o object as linux-mdep.c
 *  - drivers/modules also to be linked into streams.o, and will thus not
 *    include <linux/module.h>
 *  - drivers/modules to be separate loadable modules, which will include
 *    <linux/module.h> for themselves
 *
 *  I have decided that the development versions of these routines are not
 *  easily workable.  They had to be defined in linux-mdep.c as callables,
 *  but as such, also had to be inter-module calls, whose names were
 *  exported symbols.  This is somewhat circular, considering that these
 *  routines concern the loading of modules in the first place.  Second,
 *  only the parameter-less MOD_[INC,DEC]_USE_COUNT macros were used, which
 *  makes no sense for counting references from an entirely other module.
 *  So, the development mode routines have been dropped, at least for
 *  now; they may be added back in later.  (JB 05/18/04)
 *
 *  In production mode, separate loadable modules will use the inline
 *  routines here.  Sources like head.c which are to be included in
 *  streams.o without themselves including <linux/module.h> will not be
 *  able to define such inlines, so they will call the ..._local routines,
 *  which linux-mdep.c will also define.  These need not be exported
 *  symbols, since the calls will be within streams.o.
