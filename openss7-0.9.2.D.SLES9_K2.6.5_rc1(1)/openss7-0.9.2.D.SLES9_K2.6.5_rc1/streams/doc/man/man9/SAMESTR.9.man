.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int SAMESTR(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to compare against the next queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
tests whether the next queue belongs to the same stream as the specified
queue
.IR q .
.BR SAMESTR ()
can be used to detect whether or not
.I q
belongs to a
.BR pipe (4)
or a
.BR fifo (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
is not normally used by drivers or modules.  Although it can be used by a module to detect the midpoint of
a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or
.BR fifo (4),
it is not often done.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
returns true (1) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
belongs to the same stream (read or write) as the specified queue
.IR q .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is above the midpoint of a
.BR pipe (4)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
returns false (0) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
belongs to a different stream (read or write) as the specified queue
.IR q .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is above the midpoint of a
.BR pipe (4)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
also returns false (0) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
is
.BR NULL .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is a stream end (stream head or driver).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR SAMESTR ()
fails, it returns
zero (0).
.BR SAMESTR ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q->q_next
is
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is
.BR NULL ,
a kernel panic may occur.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR SAMESTR ()
is defined for
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7spg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.[
suxspg
.]
.IR LiS .
.[

.]
These systems also support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe "(4) and " fifo (4).
.IP \(em
.BR SAMESTR ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR SAMESTR ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
This is presumably because
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
allows frozen streams to manipulate the
.I q->q_next
pointers directly.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
on the other hand, does not allow
.I q->q_next
pointers to be manipulated directly and provides the
.BR weldq (9)
function to perform that action.
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR bcanputnext ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
lists
.BR SAMESTR ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
also lists
.BR SAMESTR ()
as a utility that cannot be called from user functions or
.RI non- STREAMS
code; that is, contexts asynchronous to the Stream containing
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR HP-UX \(rg
compatible drivers and modules will not call
.BR SAMESTR ()
from outside of a
.BR qinit (9)
routine for the queue pair of
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.BR SAMESTR ()
is not defined for
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR UXP/V \(rg.
.[
uxpspg
.]
These systems do not support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe "(4) and " fifo (4).
.IP \(em
.BR SAMESTR ()
is not very useful on systems that do not support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.IP \(em
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
supports
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe "(4) and " fifo (4).
.IP \(em
Because the size and members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure vary from implementation to implementation,
binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
