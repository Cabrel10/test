.SH ARGUMENTS

The device number to convert to an external (real) major device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR emajor (9),
.BR eminor (9)
and
.BR mkdev (9)
are a group of architectural specific macros intended to supplement the
architectural independent
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
functions
.BR major (9),
.BR minor (9)
and
.BR makedev (9).
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is an architectural specific macro that obtains the external (real) major
device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.BR major (9),
on the other hand,
will return the external
.I base
major device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.PP
.BR major (9)
supports the concept of extended minor device numbers.
Under extended minor device numbers, a device has a single base major device
number and an extended range of minor device numbers (exceeding 255).
Real device numbers consist of a number of major device numbers and a range of
minor device numbers associated with each major device number from 0 to 255.
.PP
Following is an example contrasting the mapping of external major and minor
device numbers to a base major device number and an extended minor device
number:

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is used by drivers that require knowledge of the external (real) major device
number and for use internal to the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.PP
Normally, a
.I STREAMS
module or driver
.BR qopen (9)
procedure will use the
.BR major (9)
function to obtain the external
.I base
major device number and deal with the assignment of extended minor device
numbers using the
.BR minor (9)
and
.BR makedevice (9)
functions.
.PP
The
.BR emajor ()
.IR "SVR 3" -style
architecture dependent macro is obsolete and should be replaced in
portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules with a call to the
.I SVR 4
architecture independent
.I getemajor ()
function call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR emajor ()
returns the external (real) base major device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR emajor ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is a
.I SVR 3
specific macro:
.BR _SVR3_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3_MODULE
defined.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR emajor ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR emajor ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR emajor ()
is an
.B extern inline
function call.
.I SVR 3
implements
.BR emajor ()
as a system dependent macro.
.IP \(em
.I SVR 3
includes
.B sys/sysmacros.h
instead of
.BR sys/ddi.h .
.IP \(em
.BR emajor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.I SVR 3
for the purpose of porting
.I SVR 3
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 3" ,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR emajor ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.I SVR 3
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR emajor ()
in support of
.RB non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
