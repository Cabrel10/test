.IR stderr .
Option and command line syntax errors are still reported.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
When the
.BR -f " or " -file
.I filename
option is specified, the format the supplied file contains autopush specified
entries.
.IP \(bu
Each line in the file contains one entry or comment per line.
.IP \(bu
Each entry consists of of a number of fields delimited by whitespace (see
.BR isspace (3)).
.IP \(bu
Any field that begins with a
.RI \' # \'
character is a comment that continues to the end of the line.
.IP \(bu
Any line containing only a comment (beginning with optional whitespace and a
.RI \' # \'
character) is ignored.
.PP
Each line containing an autopush specification entry consists of the following
fields:
.TP
(1) [\fImajor\fP|\fIname\fP]
The major device number.  This field is either a device name (not beginning
with a digit), or a decimal, hexadecimal or octal major device number
specifying the device to be configured with an autopush list.
.sp
This field is mandatory.
.TP
(2) \fIminor\fP
The minor device number.  This field is a decimal, hexadecimal or octal minor
device number specifying a single minor device or the start of a range of
minor devices.  If the
.I minor
field is
.BR -1 ,
then all minor devices are specified and the field
.I lastminor
is ignored.
.sp
This field is mandatory.
.TP
(3) \fIlastminor\fP
The last minor device number in a range.  This field is a decimal, hexadecimal
or octal minor device number specifying the last of a range of minor devices
in combination with the
.I minor
field, above.  If the
.I lastminor
field is
.BR -1 ,
and the
.I minor
field is specified, it indicates that the minor device is a
.BR clone (4)
deviec or a redirected open channel, and the
.I module
fields must be absent.
.sp
This field is mandatory.
.TP
(4+) \fImodule\fP
The list of module names (separated by whitespace but on the same line) to be
configured against the specified major and minor device or minor device range.
Each module name is the name of the module as it appears (or will appear when
loaded) in the
.B /proc/streams/modules
entry.
The special name
.RI \*(lq [anchor] \*(rq
is used to indicate that an anchor point should be inserted between the
modules.
.RI \*(lq [anchor] \*(rq
can appear multiple times in the list, but only the last such ocurrence will
have any effect.
For more information on anchor points, see the
.I I_ANCHOR
IO control in
.BR streamio (7).
.sp
One of these fields is mandatory when the
.I lastminor
field is other than
.BR -1 .
These fields must be absent when the
.I lastminor
field is
.BR -1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of two (2) indicates that option syntax was in error.
.TP
.BR -f " or " --file
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that all entries in the
provided file were configured as specified; one (1) indicates that at least
one entry was not configured.  Diagnostics concerning the line of the file
that failed is printed on
.IR stderr .
.TP
.BR -g " or " --get
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the specified autopush
list was retrieved, and printed on
.IR stdout ;
one (1) indicates that the specified device is not configured with an autopush
list and a diagnostic is printed on
.IR stderr .
.TP
.BR -r " or " --reset
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the specified autopush
list was cleared; one (1) indicates that the specified device is not
configured with an autopush list and a diagnostic is printed on
.IR stderr .
.TP
.BR -s " or " --set
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the autopush module
list was configured as specified; one (1) indicates that an error occurred and
the autopush list was not configured.  A diagnostic is printed on
.IR stderr .
.TP
.BR -c " or " --clone
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the clone minor
was configured as specified; one (1) indicates that an error occurred and
the clonable minor was not configured.  A diagnostic is printed on
.IR stderr .
.TP
.BR -V " or " --verify
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that all modules in the
verification list where present in the system; one (1) indicates that at least
one module in the list was not present in the system.
.PP
All other failures result in an exit status of one (1) and a diagnostic is
printed on
.IR stderr .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.BR -N " or " -M
option may result in the loading of the kernel module corresponding to the
.I STREAMS
driver.  The kernel module loaded will be named
.BI char-major- nnn \fR,
where
.I nnn
is the major device number sought.  This can be a negative side effect if the
major device number does not correspond to a
.I STREAMS
device.
.PP
The
.B -V
option may result in the loading of the kernel module corresponding to
the named
.I STREAMS
module.  The kernel module loaded will be named
.BI streams- xxx \fR,
where
.I xxx
is the module name.
.PP
.B autopush
does not check the credentials of the user.  Any user with permission to
access the
.I STREAMS
Administrative Driver
.BR sad (4)
device
.BR /dev/sad/admin ,
can execute all options.
For security, 
.B autopush
should never be setuid root,
instead, the file permissions on device
.B /dev/sad/admin
should be adjusted to permit authorized access.
