.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1
mount -t specfs none /dev/streams
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B specfs
file system is a
.B Linux
file system
[see
.BR fs (5)]
that provides a
.I STREAMS
shadow special file system that supports
.I STREAMS
special character devices.
The
.B specfs
file system is always loaded and present in the kernel when the
.B streams
kernel module is loaded.
.PP
When
.BR open (2s)
is performed on a character special device corresponding to a
.I STREAMS
driver, the inode attached to the file pointer associated with the opening file
descriptor is replaced with an inode from the
.B specfs
file system that represents a minor node of the
.I STREAMS
character special device.  The original external inode (as a device in the
.B /dev
directory) no longer plays a part until another
.BR open (2s)
is performed.  This is in fitting with the description of the
.I vnode
and
.I snode
in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden" \(rq.
.[
magic
.]
.\"
.PP
In support of naming streams [see
.BR fattach (2),
.BR fattach (3),
.BR fdetach (3)
and
.BR fdetach (8)]
directory entries (devices) in the
.B specfs
file system can be mounted on files in other file systems.
The
.B Linux
kernel supports file on file mounting, and the
.BR fattach (3)
and
.BR fdetach (3)
user functions are provided by
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
to permit mounting and unmounting of device nodes from the
.I specfs
file system on regular files in other file systems.
.\"
.\"
.PP
As an additional feature, the entire
.B specfs
file system is mountable.  Recommended practise is to create a mount point in
the device directory
.B /dev/streams
and mount the
.B specfs
file system there with a command similar to the following in a boot script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
mount -t specfs specfs /dev/streams
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
It is also possible to mount the
.B specfs
file system at more than one mount point in more than one file system.  The
directory hierarchy that is rooted at the mount point is identical to all
mount points.
This permits the
.B specfs
file system to be mounted on the
.B /device
mount point in a fashion similar to
.IR Solaris \(rg.
See
.BR mount (8)
for additional information.
.\"
.\"
.SH "MOUNT OPTIONS"
.PP
The
.B specfs
file system accepts the following options to the
.BR mount (8)
command:
.TP \w'\fBmode=\fIvalue\fR\(em'u
.BI uid= value
Set the user for all directory and device nodes created within the
.B specfs
file system.
The value must be numeric, but can be decimal, hexadecimal or octal in shell
notation.  See
.BR strtoul (3).
The default is to use the user id of the user creating the directory or node.
.TP
.BI gid= value
Set the group for all directory and device nodes created within the
.B specfs
file system.
The value must be numeric, but can be decimal, hexadecimal or octal in shell
notation.  See
.BR strtoul (3).
The default is to use the group id of the user creating the directory or node.
.TP
.BI mode= value
Set the mode for all directories and device nodes created within the
.B specfs
file system.
The value must be numeric, but can be decimal, hexadecimal or octal in shell
notation.  See
.BR strtoul (3).
The default is to use the mode specified by the device driver at initialization.
.\"
.\"
.SH "DIRECTORY FORMAT"
.PP
.PP
When mounted at
.BR /dev/streams  " or " /device ,
the
.B specfs
file system exhibits a number of special properties:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
Attempting to read the
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
directory, where the 
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
directory does not yet exist, will result in an attempt to demand load the
.I STREAMS
kernel module named
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
and if that is not successful, the kernel module named
.BI streams- devname\fR.
.IP 2.
Attempting to
.BR open (2s)
a character special device in a device directory named
.BI /dev/streams/ devname / nnnn
will result in the
.RI \(lq nnnn 'th\(rq
instance of the
.I devname
driver being opened.
.IP 3.
Calls to
.BR register_strnod (9)
and
.BR unregister_strnod (9),
or the
.IR Solaris \(rg
SUNDDI functions
.BR ddi_create_minor_node (9)
and
.BR ddi_remove_minor_node (9),
from within a
.I STREAMS
driver will create or remove the named node
.BI /dev/streams/ devname / minname
device node, where
.I devname
is the name of the driver invoking these function, and
.I minname
is the requested name for the minor device node.
.IP 4.
A device node,
.BI /dev/streams/clone/ devname
will be created when a
.I STREAMS
driver named
.I devname
registers using the
.BR register_strdev (9)
utility, or any of the other compatibility
.I STREAMS
driver registration functions.
.PP
The behaviour is similar in some respects to the
.IR Solaris \(rg
.B /device
file system, the
.B Linux
.BR devfs ,
and the
.B Linux
.BR ptsfs .
.PP
These characteristics greatly simply device naming and numbering.  A simple
symbolic link within the
.B /dev
file system is sufficient to demand load the necessary kernel module and open
the appropriate instances of the
.I STREAMS
device without need to reference device major or device minor numbers.  For a
discussion of the other methods of device naming and numbering, see
.BR dev_t (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Device nodes in a
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /\fR,
subdirectory such as
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /299\fR,
return to
.BR stat (2),
.BR fstat (2)
or
.BR lstat (2)
the truncated internal device number in the
.I st_dev
field of the
.B stat
structure.
(The truncated internal device number is the internal device number of the
device composed of module ID as major device component and instance number
as minor device component truncated to OS limits.  Under Linux 2.4 kernels,
this is the 16-bit module ID truncated to an 8-bit major device number and the
16-bit instance number truncated to an 8-bit minor device number.)
.PP
.I STREAMS
devices other than pipes, fifos or sockets return
.B S_IFCHR
in the
.I st_mode
field indicating that the device is a character special device.
The node types for pipes, fifos or sockets are appropriately returned as
.BR S_IFIFO ", " S_IFIFO " and " S_IFSODCK .
.PP
Permission set on directories and device nodes within the
.B specfs
file system do not affect the permissions on normal
.B /dev
character special device nodes corresponding to
.I STREAMS
devices.
.PP
Mounting the
.B specfs
file system presents some unique security concerns listed below.  The most
secure approach is to not mount the file system.
.IP a) \w'm)\(em'u
Any user with create permission to the
.B /dev/streams
mount point can cause arbitrary kernel modules aliased
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
or
.BI streams- devname
to be loaded by simply listing or entering the
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
subdirectory.
.IP b)
Any user with the permissions to open or create a device node in a
.BI /dev/streams/ devname /
subdirectory can create a new Stream or open an existing Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.B specfs
file system is implemented with the
.I SPECFS
kernel module,
.BR specfs ,
as a normal pseudo-file system under
.B Linux .
.PP
When the
.B specfs
is compiled as a loadable kernel module and the kernel is configured for
.BR kmod ,
mounting the special file system will demand-load the kernel module.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B specfs
file system is compatible with
descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Although the
.B specfs
file system can be mounted at the
.B /device
mount point similar to
.IR Solaris \(rg,
the device hierarchy presented at the
.B /device
mount point is not necessarily the same as
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.IP \(em
Attempts have been made to make the implementation function in the same manner
as the
.I vnode
and
.I snode
Shadow Special Filesystem
described for
.I SVR 4
in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden Explained"
.[ [\fB
magic
.] \fR];\(rq
and in the
.RI \(lq "SVR 4 STREAMS Programmer's Guide"
.[ [\fB
svr4spg
.] \fR],\(rq
however, there are many differences: access to the
.B specfs
file system should be left internal to the
.I STREAMS
executive\(emits structures should not be accessed directly by
portable
.I STREAMS
drivers.
.IP \(em
Neither source nor binary compatibility of the
.B specfs
file system is guaranteed.
.IP \(em
The
.B specfs
file system is provide for compatabilty with
.I SVR 4
for the purpose of porting
.I STREAMS
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions differ, binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
The
.B specfs
file system only provides functionality comparable to
.I SVR 4
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by the
.B specfs
file system in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices is not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
