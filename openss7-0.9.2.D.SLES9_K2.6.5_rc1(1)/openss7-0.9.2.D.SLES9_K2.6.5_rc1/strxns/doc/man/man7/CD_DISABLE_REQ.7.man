.SH NAME
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
\- disable a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_disposal;
} cd_disable_req_t;

/* Actions to take with undelivered data in a CD_DISABLE_REQ or CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ */
#define CD_FLUSH        0x00    /* Discard undelivered data */
#define CD_WAIT         0x01    /* Attempt to deliver unsent data */
#define CD_DELIVER      0x02
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the communication device,
previously enabled with a successful
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive, be disabled.  In addition, it specifies the disposition of unsent
messages.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_disposal
Specifies how unsent messages are to be disposed.  This field can be one of
the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_FLUSH
Discard undeliverable data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received will be discarded.  Any data awaiting transmission the
the device's write queue will be flushed.
.TP
.B CD_WAIT
Attempt to deliver unsent data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received the provider will attempt to send before confirming the
primitive.  The provider will not wait for acknowledgment of sent messages.
.TP
.B CD_DELIVER
Deliver unsent data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received the provider will deliver before confirming the
primitive.  The provider will wait for acknowledgment of sent messages.
.RE
.SS State
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CD_ENABLED .
The new state is
.BR CD_DISABLED .
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the provider to acknowledge receipt of the primitive
as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When successful, the provider confirms the receipt of the primitive with a
.BR CD_DISABLE_CON (7)
primitive indicating the success of the operation.  The new state is
.BR CD_UNATTACHED .
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider acknowledges the receipt of the primitive with
a
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive indicating the error.  The state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
