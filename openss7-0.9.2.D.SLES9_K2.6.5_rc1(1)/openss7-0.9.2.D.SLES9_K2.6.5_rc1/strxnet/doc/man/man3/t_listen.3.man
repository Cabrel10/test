.HP 8
.BI "int t_listen(int " fd ", struct t_call *" call );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to listen.
.TP
.I call
a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure to contain returned information about a connection indication.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_listen ()
listens for connection indications on the local transport endpoint specified
by
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint.
.PP
.I call
is a
.B t_call
strucutre that returns the calling endpoint's transport address, options and
connection data, and transport provider's sequence number associated with the
connection indication.
.PP
The
.B t_call
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_call {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_call
structure has the following members:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the calling endpoint's address if the
user specified a non-zero
.I call->addr.maxlen
on call.
.I call->addr.len
will return the length of the calling endpoint's address if any, returned in
.IR call->addr.buf .
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the calling endpoint's options if the user specified a
non-zero
.I call->opt.maxlen
on call.
.I call->opt.len
will return the length of the calling endpoint's options if any, returned in
.IR call->opt.buf .
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the calling endpoint's connection data if the user
specified a non-zero
.I call->udata.maxlen
on call.
.I call->udlata.len
will return the length of the calling endpoint's connection data if any,
returned in
.IR call->udata.buf .
.TP
.I sequence
returns a sequence number assigned by the transport provider and associated
with the connection indication.  This sequence number uniquely identifies the
connection indication to the transport provider and must be used in a call to
.BR t_accept "(3) or " t_snddis (3)
to identify the connection indication that is accepted or refused.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_listen ()
is only valid in state
.B T_IDLE .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_listen ()
blocks an waits for a connection indication, signal or error.
In asynchronous mode (where
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
has been set with
.BR t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2)),
and no connection indication is immediately available,
.BR t_listen ()
will return -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNODATA .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_listen ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_listen ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_listen ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADQLEN ]
The stream associated with
.I fd
was bound with a
.I qlen
of zero and is not a listening stream.
See
.BR t_bind (3).
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The \fImaxlen\fR field of a \fBnetbuf\fR(3) structure passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available opaque information.  See,
\fBnetbuf\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See \fBt_look\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TQFULL ]
No more outstanding connection indications can be received on
.IR fd .
The current backlog of outstanding connection indications must be reduced with
a call to
.BR t_accept "(3) or " t_sndis (3)
before any more calls to
.BR t_listen ()
can be made.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
