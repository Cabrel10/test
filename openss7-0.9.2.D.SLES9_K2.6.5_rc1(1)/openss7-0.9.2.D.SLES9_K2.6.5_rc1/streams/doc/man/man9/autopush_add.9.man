.B #include <sys/sad.h>
.HP
.BI "int autopush_add(struct strapush *" sap );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I sap
A pointer to a
.B strapush
structure describing the autopush information to add.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
performs the same function within the kernel as is provided to user space via
the
.B SAD_SAP
IO control to the
.IR "STREAMS Administrative Driver" ,
.BR sad (4).
This function adds an autopush list to a \fISTREAMS\fP character device.  The
character device and autopush list is specified by
.IR sap ,
which is a pointer to a
.B strapush
structure formatted as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-1
struct strapush {
        unit_t ap_cmd;
        major_t sap_major;
        minor_t sap_minor;
        minor_t sap_lastminor;
        unit_t sap_npush;
        unit_t sap_list[MAXAPUSH][FMNAMESZ + 1];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\ sap_lastminor\ 'u
.I ap_cmd
Not meaningful.
.BR autopush_add ()
ignores the value in this member.
.I ap_cmd
must be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP \w'\ SAD_RANGE\ 'u
.B SAD_ONE
the single character minor device number with which to associate the autopush list is
specified in
.IR sap_minor .
In this case
.I sap_lastminor
will always be set to the same value as
.IR sap_minor .
.TP
.B SAD_RANGE
the range of character minor device numbers with which to associate the
autopush list is specified in
.IR sap_minor " and " sap_lastminor .
.TP
.B SAD_ALL
the range of character minor device numbers with which to associated the
autopush list is the range of all minor devices.  In this case,
.I sap_minor
will always be set to zero (0) and
.I sap_lastminor
will always be set to
.BR MAX_CHRDEV .
.RE
.TP
.I sap_major
The character major device number associated with the \fISTREAMS\fP device to
which this autopush list is to be added.
.TP
.I sap_minor
The first character minor device number in a range associated with the
\fISTREAMS\fP device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value is only
significant if
.I ap_cmd
is
.BR SAD_ONE " or " SAD_RANGE .
.TP
.I sap_lastminor
The last character minor device number in a range associated with the
\fISTREAMS\fP device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value is only
significant if
.I ap_cmd
is
.BR SAD_RANGE .
When significant, the value of
.I sap_lastminor
must be greater than or equal to the value of
.IR sap_minor .
.TP
.I sap_npush
The number of modules in the autopush list.  This number must be greater than
or equal to one and less than or equal to
.BR MAXAPUSH .
.TP
.I sap_list
The array of module names that contains
.I sap_npush
module names representing the module autopush list.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
is useful along with
.BR autopush_del (9)
and
.BR autopush_find (9)
when registering \fISTREAMS\fP character devices with
.BR register_strdev (9).
.BR autopush_add ()
permits a kernel module to add an autopush list to a \fISTREAMS\fP device.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
is a
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" -specific
function.
.BR autopush_add ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  Instead, the
user-space
.I STREAMS
autopush utility
.BR sad (8)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR autopush_add ()
adds the autopush list
specified by
.I sap
and returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR autopush_add ()
does not add the specified autopush list
.I sap
and returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR autopush_add ()
fails, it returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'\ [EEXIST]\ 'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap_major
was invalid.
.I sap_major
must be in the range from zero (0) to
.BR MAX_CHRDEV .
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap_minor
was invalid.
.I sap_minor
must be in the range from zero (0) to 255.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap_npush
is less than one (1) or greater than
.BR MAXAPUSH .
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap_list
contains invalid information (e.g. zero length names or names that are not
null terminated after
.BR FMNAMESZ
characters).
.TP
.RB [ ERANGE ]
.I sap_lastminor
was significant, yet less than
.IR sap_minor .
.TP
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
.IR sap_major ", " sap_minor " and " sap_lastminor
specify a character device minor node that is not associated with a
\fISTREAMS\fP device.
.TP
.RB [ EEXIST ]
an autopush entry for the specified minor device number
.RI ( sap_minor ),
or a subset of the specified range of minor device numbers
.RI ( sap_minor " and " sap_lastminor ),
already exists.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
insufficient \fISTREAMS\fP resources were available to successfully complete
the call.  This is caused by the inability to allocate cache storage to hold
the autopush description.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
can only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible to ensure exclusive access to the
passed in
.B strapush
structure
.IR sap .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR autopush_add ()
simply adds the
.B strapush
structure
specified by
.I sap
to the specified \fISTREAMS\fP character device.  The module name list added
is not validated, and no modules are loaded as a side-effect of the addition.
.BR autopush_add ()
will, however, attempt to load a kernel module associated with the character
major device number specified by
.IR sap_major ,
if the associated kernel module has not been loaded.  See
.BR register_strdev (9)
for more information.
