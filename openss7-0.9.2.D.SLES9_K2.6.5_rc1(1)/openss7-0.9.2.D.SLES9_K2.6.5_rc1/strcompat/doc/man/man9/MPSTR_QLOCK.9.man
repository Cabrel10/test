.SH NAME
.B MPSTR_QLOCK
\- acquire a queue for exclusive access
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "pl_t MPSTR_QLOCK(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'priority\(em'u
.I q
A pointer to the
.B queue (9)
structure to acquire for exclusive access.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
acquires an exclusive (write) lock on the
.BR queue (9)
structure specified by the
.I q
argument.
If the lock is held by a process on another processor, the calling processor
will spin until the lock is acquired.
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QRELE (9)
is used to release the lock once it has been acquired.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is used to gain exclusive access to a
.BR queue (9)
structure for the purpose of manipulating members of the
structure
and related
.BR qband (9)
structures or
.BR msgb (9)
messages stored on the queue,
in an atomic fashion.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
returns the interrupt priority level
.RB ( spl )
that was in effect at the time of the call.  For the duration of time that the
lock is held, interrupts are disabled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is always successful.  Calling
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
with invalid or uninitialized arguments will yield indeterminate results.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
can be called from any context, except interrupt service routines.  If a
process on another processor holds the lock, the calling processor will spin
awaiting release of the lock.  If acquired from a user or blocking context,
care should be taken that the calling process does not sleep before releasing
the lock with
.BR MPSTR_QRELE (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
does not provide exclusive access to the
.I q_flag
member of the
.BR queue (9)
structure.  The
.I q_flag
member is accessed separately with atomic bit operations.
.PP
Use of
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
has a direct impact on
.I STREAMS
performance.
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
takes a write lock on the
.BR queue (9)
structure specified by
.IR q ,
so all other read and write accesses to members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure is blocked until the lock is released.  In addition, interrupts are
disabled for the duration that the lock is held.  Although this lock is less
severe than
.BR freezestr (9),
the period of time that a queue is locked with
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
should be kept to a bare minimum.
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
takes a write lock on the
.I q_rwlock
member of the
.BR queue (9)
structure specified by
.IR q ,
nested on the owning
.B task_struct
task structure as specfied by
the
.IR q_owner " and " q_nest
members.
In addtion,
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
returns the current interrupt mask and suppresses interrupts.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following is an example of using
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
to permit safe direct write access to members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
pl_t pl;

pl = MPSTR_QLOCK(q);
{
	/* directly access some queue members */
	q->q_hiwat = (q->q_lowat << 2);
}
MPSTR_QRELE(q, pl);

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux
does not have interrupt priority levels in the same sense as
.IR "SVR 4.2" .
The
.B pl_t
return value of
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
corresponds to interrupt flags rather that
.BR spl .
See
.BR splx (9)
for more information.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.
.I "SVR 4.2 MP"
and systems based on
.I "SVR 4.2"
implement
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
as a C preprocessor macro.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is implemented as a recursive (nesting) lock, meaning that it can be called on
a queue already locked by
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ().
Some systems based on
.I "SVR 4.2 MP"
implement
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
as a non-recursive lock.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
