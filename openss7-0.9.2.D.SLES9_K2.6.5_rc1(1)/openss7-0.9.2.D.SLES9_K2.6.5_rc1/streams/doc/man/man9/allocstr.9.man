.HP
.B struct stdata *allocstr(void);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
dynamically allocates and returns a
.I STREAMS
internal Stream head,
.BR stdata (9)
structure.
.BR stdata (9)
structures allocated with
.BR allocstr ()
can be freed with
.BR freestr (9).
.PP
Some implementations accept a queue pair as an argument.
.BR allocstr ()
allocates a queue pair for the Stream head using
.BR allocq (9)
and accepts no agruments.
.\"
.SS /proc File System
.PP
A
.BR stdata (9)
structure is dynamically allocated for every instance of a Stream head.
.BR allocstr ()
monitors the number of
.BR stdata (9)
structures currently allocated, and the high water mark for allocations since the last reboot.  The
counts and high water mark can be viewed in the
.BR proc (5)
file system under
.BR /proc/streams/strinfo .
See
.BR strinfo (5)
for details.
.\"
.\"
.\".SH USAGE
.\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR allocstr ()
will return a pointer to a
.I STREAMS
stream head.
.HP
Upon failure,
.BR allocstr ()
will return a
.B NULL
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR allocstr ()
will return a
.BR NULL
pointer.
.BR allocstr ()
fails when there is insufficient cache memory to satisfy the allocation request.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call outs, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
is an internal function, and is not recommended for usage by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.BR allocstr ()
is only made available for use by specialized modules distributed with this
.I STREAMS
package (such as
.BR connld (4)),
and for compatibility with
.I SVR 3
systems predating the
.IR "SVR 4 DDI/DKI" .
Unlike
.BR allocq (9),
(which makes some sense for private queue pairs),
.BR allocstr ()
poses no useful portable purpose.
.BR allocstr ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
simply calls
.BR allocq (9)
to allocate a queue pair, allocates an
.BR stdata (9)
structure from memory cache, and intializes the
.BR stdata (9)
structure to point to the allocated queue pair, and returns a pointer to the
.BR stdata (9)
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freestr (9),
.IR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR allocstr ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[

with the following portability considerations:

.\".IP \(em
Some older
.I AT&T
header files from
.IR "SVR 3"
show this function as accepting a

pointer as an argument.  Others do not.
.IP ""
.BR allocstr ()
will not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR allocstr ()
should not be called by normal
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules and is implementation specific.
.IP \(em
This function is not exported by
.I "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
or any other UNIX directly.  It is declared in some earlier
.I SVR 3
.I <sys/stream.h>
header files.
.IP \(em
Source and binary compatibility is not guaranteed, even from version to version and release to
release.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Although
.BR allocstr ()
appears in some early
.I AT&T
header files, it is not documented in the
.IR "SVR 4.2 STREAMS Programmer's Guide" .
