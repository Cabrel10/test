.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" msg " = copymsg(struct msgb *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to a message to copy.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR copymsg ()
generates a new copy of each of the message blocks and data blocks and buffers
in the message indicated by
.IR mp ,
and returns a pointer to the new message as
.IR msg .
The new data blocks each have the same type as the copied data blocks and the
.IR b_rptr " and " b_wptr
of each block in the new message are set to the beginning and end of the
copied data from the corresponding blocks in the old message.
.PP
.BR copymsg ()
simply iterates calls to
.BR copyb (9)
over the blocks in the message and links the copied blocks into the new
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR copymsg ()
returns a pointer,
.IR msg ,
to the copied message.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR copymsg ()
returns a
.B NULL
.I msg
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR copymsg ()
fails, it returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.BR copymsg ()
fails if memory allocation for a message block fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR copymsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR copymsg ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the passed in message.  Upon return, the caller will have the only
reference to the returned message.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR copymsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,

.IP \(em
.BR copymsg ()
fails if memory allocation for message blocks fails.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR copymsg ()
can fail because the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
the size of any of the blocks to be copied has a negative message length (i.e.
the
.I b_wptr
pointer is less than the
.IR b_rptr );
if any of the data blocks are mangled (i.e. the
.I db_lim
pointer is less than the
.IR db_base );
or, memory allocation for any of the copied blocks fails.
