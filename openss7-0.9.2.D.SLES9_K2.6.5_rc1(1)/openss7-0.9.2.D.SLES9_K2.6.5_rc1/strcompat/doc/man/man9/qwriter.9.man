.BI "void qwriter(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp ", void (*" func ")(queue_t *, mblk_t *), int " perim );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to upgrade to writer.
.TP
.I mp
a
.I STREAMS
message to pass to the callback function.
.TP
.I func
a function that will be called when write access has been achieved.
.TP
.I perim
a description of the perimeter.
.I perim
can be either
.BR PERIM_INNER " or " PERIM_OUTER .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
schedules the call-out function,
.IR func ,
to be executed with the specified queue pair,
.IR q ,
and the passed in message,
.IR mp ,
once the perimeter,
.IR perim ,
can be entered exclusively.
.PP
.I perim
can be one of the following values:
.TP
.B PERIM_INNER
establishes exclusive access to the inner perimeter
for the queue,
.IR q ,
when present.  An inner
perimeter can exist at the queue, the queue pair or the module.
See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.
If an inner perimeter does not exist, the call-out function is still executed,
but synchronization does not occur.
(This has a similar effect to
.BR qprocsoff (9),
although
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is a different mechanism.)
.TP
.B PERIM_OUTER
establishes exclusive access to the outer perimeter
for the module to which
.I q
belongs,
when present.  An outer
perimeter can exist at the module.
See
.BR mp-streams (9)
for more information.
If an outer perimeter does not exist, the call-out function is still executed,
but synchronization does not occur.
(This has a similar effect to
.BR freezestr (9),
although
.BR freezestr (9)
is a different mechanism.)

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
can only be called by a 
.BR put (9)
or 
.BR srv (9)
procedure or from a queue callback function (see
.BR qtimeout (9)
or
.BR qbufcall (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Considerations should be given when writing the call-out function that the
function may execute in parallel with asynchronous entry points, callbacks,
call-outs and interrupt service procedures.
.PP
However, in
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
the call-out function is scheduled on the same CPU and the CPU which called
.BR qwriter ().
This means that
.BR qwriter ()
will return before the call-out function executes.  In addition, the call-out
function will not execute before the calling function returns or the next
preemption point is encountered.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
must only be called from a queue
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure.
.PP
.BR qwriter ()
may return before the call-out function,
.IR func ,
executes, or the call-out function,
.IR func ,
may be executed on the calling thread before
.BR qwriter ()
returns.

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.BR qwriter ()
is source level compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg

with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qwriter ()
