## A little bit different approach: we want this information included at the top
## of the makefile, so we put it here in comments.  The help target processes
## the makefile fragment to make README-help and then cats README-help.  We use
## the special comment leader '#@ ' so we know what to extract.  Include this
## file at the top of any Makefile.am that you want to have the help target.

#!
#! Automake has many targets, not all of which are obvious to the causal user.
#! In addition, OpenSS7 automake files have additional rules added to make
#! maintaining and releasing a package somewhat easier.  This list of targets
#! provides some help with what targets can be invoked, what they do, and what
#! they hope to acheive.  The available targets are as follows:
#!
#!
#! User Targets:
#! -------------
#!
#! The following are normal targets intended to be invoked by installers of the
#! package.  They are concerned with compiling, checking the compile,
#! installing, checking the installation, and uninstalling the package.
#!
#! [all]:
#!     Compiles the package.  This si performed after configuring the source
#!     with 'configure'.  We provide a makefile stub so that if the package has
#!     not had autoreconf run (such as when checked out from CVS, the package
#!     will attempt to run 'autoreconf -fiv'.
#!
#!     All openss7 packages are configured without maintainer mode and without
#!     dependency tracking by default.  This speeds compiling of the package for
#!     one-time builds.  This also means that if you are developing using the
#!     source package (edit-compile-test cycle), changes made to source files
#!     will not cause the automatic rebuilding due to dependencies.  There are
#!     two ways to enable dependency tracking: specify --enable-maintainer-mode
#!     to 'configure'; or, specify --enable-dependency-tracking to 'configure'.
#!     I use the former during my edit-compile-test cycle.
#!
#!     This target does not require root privilege.
#!
#! check:
#!     All openss7 packages provide check scripts for the check target.  This
#!     step is performed after compiling the package and will run all of the
#!     check programs against the compiled binaries.  Which checks are performed
#!     depends on whether --enable-maintainer-mode was specified to configure.
#!     If in maintainer mode, checks that assist with the release of the package
#!     will be run (such as checking that all manual pages load properly and
#!     that they have required sections.)  We recommend running the check stage
#!     before installing, because it catches problems that might keep the
#!     installed package from functioning properly.
#!
#!     Another way to enable the greater set of checks, without invoking
#!     maintainer mode, is to specify --enable-checks to 'configure'.
#!
#!     This target does not require root privilege.
#!
#! install:
#!     The install target installs the package.  This target also performs some
#!     actions similar to the pre- and post-install scripts used by packaging
#!     tools such as rpm or deb.
#!
#!     This target requires root privilege.
#!
#! installcheck:
#!     All openss7 packages provide test scripts for the installcheck target.
#!     Test scripts are created and run using autotest (part of the autoconf
#!     package).  Which test suites are run and how extensive they are depends
#!     on whether --enable-maintainer-mode was specified to 'configure'.  When
#!     in maintainer mode, all test suites will be run.  When not in maintainer
#!     mode, only a few post-install checks will be performed, but the test
#!     suites themselves will be installed in @libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@ for later
#!     use.
#!
#!     This target might require root privilege.  Tests requiring root privilege
#!     will be skipped when run as a regular user.  Tests requiring regular
#!     account privileges will be skipped when run as root.
#!
#! retest:
#!     To complement the installcheck target above, all openss7 packages provide
#!     the retest target as a means to rerun failed conformance testsuite test
#!     cases.  The retest target is provided because some test cases in the
#!     testsuites have delicate timing considerations that allow them to fail
#!     sporadically.  Invoking this target will retest the failed cases until
#!     no cases that are not expected failures remain.
#!
#!     As with installcheck, this target might require root privilege.  Tests
#!     requiring root privilege will be skpped when run as a regular user.
#!     Tests requiring regular account privileges will be skipped when run as
#!     root.
#!
#! uninstall:
#!     This target will reverse the steps taken to install the package.  This
#!     target also performs pre- and post- erase scripts used by packaging tools
#!     such as rpm or deb.  You need to have a configured build directory from
#!     which to execute this target, however, you do not need to have compiled
#!     any of the files in that build directory.
#!
#!     This target requires root privilege.
#!
#! remove:
#!     This target is like `uninstall' with the exception that it uninstalls in
#!     the reverse order that installation was performed.
#!
#! Configure Options:
#! ------------------
#!
#! There are also some configure script options that change the behaviour of
#! some of the targets.  These options are as follows:
#!
#!
#! Maintainer Targets:
#! -------------------
#!
#! The following targets are targets intended for use by maintainers of the
#! package, or those responsible for rerelease and packaging of a derivative
#! work of the package.  Some of these targets are only effective when
#! maintainer mode has been invoked (--enable-maintainer-mode specified to
#! 'configure'.)
#!
#! dist:
#!     Creates a distribution package (tarball) in the top level build
#!     directory.  OpenSS7 packages distribute two archives: a gzip tar archive
#!     and a bzip tar archive.  These archives will have the name
#!     @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.gz and @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
#!
#!     This target does not require root privilege.
#!
#! distcheck:
#!     This target is intended for use when releasing the package.  It creates
#!     the tar archives above and then unpacks the tarball in a source
#!     directory, configures in a separate build directory, compiles the
#!     package, installs the package in a separate install directory, tests the
#!     install package to ensure that some components work, and, finally, uses
#!     the unpacked source tree to build another tarball.  If you have added or
#!     removed files from the package, this is a good way to ensure that
#!     everything is still kosher for release.
#!
#!     This target does not require root privilege.
#!
#!
#! Clean Targets:
#! --------------
#!
#! mostlyclean:
#!     Cleans out most of the files from the compile stage.  This target is
#!     helpful if you have not enabled dependency tracking and need to recompile
#!     with changes.
#!
#! clean:
#!     Cleans all the files from the build directory generated during the `make
#!     [all]' phase.  It does not, however, remove files from the directory left
#!     there from the `configure' run.  Use the `distclean' target to remove
#!     those too.
#!
#! distclean:
#!     This target cleans out the directories left behind by distcheck and
#!     removes all the `configure' and generated files from the build directory.
#!     This will effectively remove all the files in the build directory, with
#!     the except of files that belong to you or some other process.
#!
#! maintainer-clean:
#!     This target not only removes files from the build directory, it removes
#!     generated files from the source directory as well.  Care should be taken
#!     when invoking this target, because it removes files generated by the
#!     maintainer and distributed with the archive that might require special
#!     tools to regenerate.  These special tools might only be available to the
#!     maintainer (but they aren't).  It also means that you probably need a
#!     full blown Linux system to rebuild the package.
