Linux STREAMS (LiS)
-------------------

Although this master package includes LiS (in the LiS subdirectory), it
configures and compiles by default with Linux Fast-STREAMS (in the
streams subdirectory).

LiS is deprecated.  If at all possible, do no use it.  Some of the other
packages contained in the master package might no longer compile or
operate with LiS.  They are only tested against Linux Fast-STREAMS.
