.SH ARGUMENTS

a pointer to a

structure describing the \fISTREAMS\fP driver from which to retrieve the
autopush list.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
gets the autopush list associated with the \fISTREAMS\fP character device
specified in
.IR sap->sap_major " and " sap->sap_minor
from the module list in the passed in
.B strapush
structure,
.IR sap .
.PP
.I sap
is a pointer to a
.B strapush
structure as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct strapush {
        unsigned long sap_cmd;
        major_t sap_major;
        minor_t sap_minor;

        char sap_list[MAXAPUSH][FMNAMESZ + 1];

.TP
.I sap_cmd
ignored on call and unchanged on return.
.TP
.I sap_major
on call specifies the major device number of the \fISTREAMS\fP character
special device for which to get the list of autopush modules; unchanged on
return.
.TP
.I sap_minor
on call specifies the minor device number of the \fISTREAMS\fP character
special device for which to get the list of autopush modules.  On successful
return, this value indicates the first minor device number in the range of
minor device numbers for which the passed in
.I sap_minor
belongs.
.TP
.I sap_lastminor
ignored on call and on return indicates the last minor device number in the
range of minor device number for which the passed in
.I sap_minor
belongs.
.TP
.I sap_npush
ignored on call and set on return to equal the number of autopush module names
returned in
.IR sap_list .
.TP
.I sap_list
the list of the returned names of autopush modules.

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
is an
.IR LiS -specific
function.
The macro definition
.B _LIS_SOURCE
must be defined before including
.I STREAMS
header files to expose the prototype for this function.
Also,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must have been compiled with
kernel configuration parameter
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_LIS_COMPAT
defined.
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR apush_get ()
returns zero (0) and the completed
.B strapush
structure pointed to by
.IR sap .
Upon failure,
.BR apush_get ()
leaves the
.B strapush
pointed to by
.I sap
structure unchanged and returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR apush_get ()
returns one of the following negative error numbers:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap->sap_major " or " sap->sap_minor
were invalid.
.TP
.RB [ ENODEV ]
a \fISTREAMS\fP character special device did not exist for the specified
.I sap->sap_major " and " sap->sap_minor
combination and a kernel module associated with the device was not
successfully loaded.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
is MP-safe.
The caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in
.B strapush
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR apush_get ()
is functionally equivalent to the
.BR SAD_GAP
ioctl to the
.BR sad (4)
driver.
The
.BR apush_get ()
function is a useful way for a driver or module to manipulate the autopush
list associated with a \fISTREAMS\fP driver.
.PP
Calling
.BR apush_get ()
has the kernel module side-effect that if a \fISTREAMS\fP device associated
with
.I sap->sap_major
does not currently exist in the system, an attempt will be made to load the
character driver associated with
.I sap->sap_major
before the module list or an error will be returned.  No attempt, however, is
made to load any kernel modules associated with the autopush modules in the
list.
