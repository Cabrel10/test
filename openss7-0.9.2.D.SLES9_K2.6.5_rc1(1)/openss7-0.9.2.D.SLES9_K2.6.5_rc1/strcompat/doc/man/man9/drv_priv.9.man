.SH NAME
.B drv_priv
\- check if the current process is priviledged
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP
.BI "int drv_priv(cred_t *" crp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I crp
a pointer to the credentials to test for privilege.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR drv_priv (),
when given a references to a process'
.BR cred_t (9)
credentials structure, returns a value indicating whether the specified
credentials are privileged or not.
.BR drv_priv ()
is an
SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
DDI/DKI function intended to insulate the
.I STREAMS
driver or module from the internals of the
.BR cred_t (9)
credentials structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
returns zero (0) if the process is privileged; it returns
.RB [ EPERM ]
if the process is not privileged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is MP-safe, however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to
the passed in credentials.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
simply checks if either the real user id or effective user id is the root user
id (equal to zero).
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is a crude way of checking permissions.  Capabilities,
.BR capable (9),
and secure access lists
should be used instead.  New programs should use Linux functions directly.
.PP
Explicit checks of whether the effective user identifier is zero (0) and
calls to the previous
.BR suser (9)
function should be replaced by
.BR drv_priv ().

.BR suser (9),
.BR fsuser (9),

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR drv_priv ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[

and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u

Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

New
