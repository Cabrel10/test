.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I hierarchy
Hierarchy value which asserts the order in which this lock will be acquired
relative to other basic and read/write locks.
.TP
.I min_pl
Minimum priority level argument that asserts the level that will be passed in
with any attempt to acquired the lock.  See
.BR LOCK (9).
.TP
.I lkinfop
A pointer to a
.B lkinfo
structure.  The
.I lk_name
member of the
.B lkinfo
structure points to a character string name that will be used to collect
statistics.
.TP
.I flag
A memory allocation flag for
.BR kmem_alloc (9).
The flag can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP \w'KM_NOSLEEP\(em'u
.B KM_SLEEP
The caller can sleep awaiting the allocation.
.PD 0
.TP
.B KM_NOSLEEP
The caller cannot sleep awaiting the allocation.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK_DEALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK (9),
.BR LOCK_OWNED (9),
.BR TRYLOCK (9)
and
.BR UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, locking,
testing, attempting to lock and unlocking a basic lock of type
.BR lock_t .
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
dynamically allocates and initializes a basic lock structure of type
.B lock_t
and returns a pointer to the structure.  When
.B KM_SLEEP
is set in the
.I flag
argument, the call will always be successful.  When
.B KM_NOSLEEP
is set in the
.I flag
argument, the call will fail if resources for the allocation are not
immediately available, and
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
will return
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAVE
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is used to dynamically allocate a basic lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the allocated an initialized
.B lock_t
structure; when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
fails when 
.I flag
is set to
.B KM_NOSLEEP
and sufficient resources for the allocation are not immediately available.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
can only be called from user or blocking context only when
.B KM_SLEEP
is set in
.IR flag .
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
can be called from any context when
.B KM_NOSLEEP
is set in
.IR flag .
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
does not perform any of the naming or statistics gathering functions described
in
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
documentation.  The
.IR lkinfop ", " hierarchy " and " min_pl
arguments are ignored.  Only the
.I flag
argument is honoured.
.PP
Basic locks of type
.B lock_t
are not recursive.  Calling
.BR LOCK (9)
for a basic lock that has been acquired by the calling processor with
.BR LOCK (9)
or
.BR TRYLOCK (9)
will result in single party deadlock.
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is implemented by allocating a
.B lock_t
structure using
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
and initialized with
.BR spinlock_init (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I heirarchy
argument.  The underlying
.B Linux
spin locks are incapable of tracking lock hierarchies.
.IP \(em
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I min_pl
argument.
.B Linux
does not implement interrupt priority levels in the same fashion as
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" :
either interrupts are enabled or they are not.
.IP \(em
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
does not perform any of the naming or statistics gathering functions described
in the
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
documentation.
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I lkinfop
argument.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
doe snot support basic, sleep, synchronization or read/write lock statistics
or debugging in the manner of
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" .
.IP \(em
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR LOCK_ALLOC ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

.BR STREAMS (9)
