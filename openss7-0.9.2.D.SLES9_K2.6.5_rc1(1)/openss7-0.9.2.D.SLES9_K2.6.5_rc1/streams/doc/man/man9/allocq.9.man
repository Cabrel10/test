a pointer to the

structure used to represent the
.I STREAMS
driver or module to which the queue pair will belong.

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,

implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Allocate a new
.BR NULL -initialized
queue pair,
.BR queue (9).
Queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq ()
can be freed with
.BR freeq (9).
.PP
Queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq ()
will have no
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
.IR qi_qopen (9),
or
.IR qi_qclose (9),
procedures associated with either
queue, will have zero maximum and minimum packet sizes and high and low water
marks; and will have no synchronization queues associated with the queue pair.
.\"
.SS /proc File System
.PP
A
.BR queue (9)
structure pair is dynamically allocated for every instance of a Stream head, driver or module,
within a Stream.
.BR allocq ()
monitors the number of
.BR queue (9)
structure pairs currently allocated, and the high water mark for allocations since the last reboot.
The counts and high water mark can be viewed in
.BR proc (5)
file system under
.BR /proc/streams/strinfo .
See
.BR strinfo (5)
for details. 
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.PP
Although this function is documented as an internal function of
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
.BR allocq ()
is not normally called directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  This function is normally internal to the
.I STREAMS
subsystem, yet,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides an exported version of this function for use by drivers and modules
so that private queue pairs can be allocated.
.PP
All
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
queue functions (e.g., 
.BR putq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR appq (9),
.BR rmvq (9))
are designed to allow them to be executed on a detached queue pair.  This function can be used to
allocate a private queue pair for use as a message buffer by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  The queue pair is not linked into any stream and no message size or water
marks or queue procedures are associated with the queue.
.PP
Message sizes, water marks and procedures can be associated with a private queue pair using
.BR setq (9).
.PP
The queue can also be pushed onto or removed from a stream using
.BR qattach (9)
and
.BR qdetach (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
Upon success,
.BR allocq ()
returns the newly allocated queue pair as a pointer to the read queue of the
pair.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR allocq ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR allocq ()
encounters and error, it fails and returns
.BR NULL .
.BR allocq ()
fails when there is insufficient
.B queinfo
cache memory available to allocate the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR allocq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR allocq ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This function should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR allocq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR allocq ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR
with the following portability considerations:

This function is not exported by

any other UNIX directly.
It is declared in some earlier

header files.
.IP \(em
Source and binary compatibility is not guaranteed, even from version to version and release to
release.

See

.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.

.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Although
.BR allocq ()
appears in some early
.I AT&T
header files, it is not documented in the
.IR "SVR 4.2 STREAMS Programmer's Guide" .
.[

.BR allocq ()
is compliant with the description of the internal
.BR allocq ()
function in

as described in

.PP
.BR mi_allocq ()

.IR MacOT \(rg.
.[

There is very little documentation avilable on
.BR mi_allocq ().

.SH HISTORY

.I STREAMS
function described in

.BR mi_allocq ()
