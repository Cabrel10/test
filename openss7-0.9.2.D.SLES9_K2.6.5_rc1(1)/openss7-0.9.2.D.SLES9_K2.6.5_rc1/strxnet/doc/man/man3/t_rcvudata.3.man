.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvudata(int " fd ", struct t_unitdata *" data ", int *" flags );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport enpoint upon which to receive unit data.
.TP
.I data
a pointer to a
.B t_unitdata
structure to contain information about the received unit data.
.TP
.I flags
a pointer to an
.B int
to contain flags concerning the received unit data.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvudata ()
received unitdata message arriving on the local transport endpoint specified
by
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which the unitdata messages are to
be reecived.
.PP
.I data
is a pointer to a
.BR t_unitdata ()
structure that returns the received unitdata message, options and originating
transport address.
.PP
.I flags
provides information about the received data on return.  Flags returned by
.BR t_rcvudata ()
can be a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
indicates that a subsequent receive operation is necessary to receive the
remainder of the data belonging to the same transport service data unit.
.PP
The
.BR t_unitdata ()
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_unitdata {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.BR t_unitdata ()
structure returns the following members and information:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the originating transport address of the received
unitdata message.
The
.I data->addr.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I data->addr.len
is significant on return.
If
.I data->addr.maxlen
is zero on call, no originating transport address will be returned.
If
.I data->addr.len
is zero on return, not originating transport address was available with the
unitdata indication.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the options associated with the received unitdata
message.
The
.I data->opt.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I data->opt.len
is significant on return.
If
.I data->opt.maxlen
is zero on call, no originating transport options will be returned.
If
.I data->opt.len
is zero on return, no originating transport options were available with the
unitdata indication.
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the received unitdata message.
The
.I data->udata.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I data->udata.len
is significant on return.
If
.I data->udata.maxlen
is zero on call, no originating data will be returned.
If
.I data->udata.len
is zero on return, no originating data was available with the unitdata
indication.

.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvudata ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_IDLE .
.PP
.BR t_rcvudata ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
will block until a unitdata indication arrives on
.IR fd .
In asynchronous mode where the is no unitdata indication immediately
available,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
will fail, return -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TNODATA ].
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvudata ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.\".TP
.\".RB [ TBADDATA ]
.\"The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
.\"provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.\".BR t_getinfo (3)
.\"and
.\".BR t_open (3)
.\"for more information.
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure
.IR "" ( addr " or " opt )
passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available and
.I fd
was in asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY " was set with " t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can occur when the transport service provider was of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_IDLE .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
