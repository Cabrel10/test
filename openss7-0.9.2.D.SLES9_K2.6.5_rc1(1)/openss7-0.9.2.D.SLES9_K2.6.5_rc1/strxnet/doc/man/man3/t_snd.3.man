.SH NAME
.B t_snd
\- send transport data
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_snd(int " fd ", char *" buf ", unsigned int " nbytes ", int " flags );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which to send data.
.TP
.I buf
is a pointer to a buffer containing the data to send.
.TP
.I nbytes
is the number of bytes in the user supplied buffer.
.TP
.I flags
specify additional information about the data to send.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_snd ()
sends connection oriented data from the local transport endpoint specified by
.IR fd .
.PP
The
.I flags
argument can be a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
specifies that the next send operation will include data belonging to the same
transport service data unit or expedited transport service data unit.
.TP
.B T_EXPEDITED
specifies that the data is part of an expedited transport service data unit.
When not set, specifies that the data is part of a normal transport service
data unit.
.TP
.B T_PUSH
specifies that any accumulated data should be sent without delay.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_snd ()
is only valid in the
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_INREL
states.
.PP
.BR t_snd ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_snd ()
blocks until there is sufficent room to buffer the message for transmission
consdering flow control.  In asynchronous mode where there is insufficient
room to buffer the data for transmission considering flow control,
.BR t_snd ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.PP
.BR t_snd ()
is functionally equivalent to
.BR write (2),
and the two functions can be used interchangeably; however,
.BR write (2)
does not maintain
.IR t_errno (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_snd ()
returns zero (0) or a positive integer reflecting the number of bytes sent.
Upon failure,
.BR t_snd ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_snd ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADFLAG ]
The argument
.I flags
contains invalid flags (i.e. flags other than
.BR T_MORE ", " T_EXPEDITED ", " T_PUSH ).
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control and
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode (i.e.
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set with
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcntl (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can happen when the transport service provider is of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
