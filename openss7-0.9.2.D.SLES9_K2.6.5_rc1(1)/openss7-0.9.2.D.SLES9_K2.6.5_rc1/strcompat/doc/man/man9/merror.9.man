.br

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'error\ \ 'u
.I q
the write-side queue pointer passed to the write-side queue put or service procedure from which
.BR merror ()
is called.
.TP
.I mp
a message pointer to a message block to be reused to generate a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message upstream.
.TP
.I error
the error number to place in the generated
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR merror ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
helper function that can be used to generate a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message upstream.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR merror ()
is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure to generate a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message upstream ot error out a stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR merror ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR merror ()
always succeeds; however, if passed an invalid pointer or argument,
.BR merror ()
could destabilize the kernel or result in a kernel panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following example is a write-side queue put or service procedure processing fragment:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1
switch (mp->b_datap->db_type) {
 ...
case M_PROTO:
{
    union T_primitives *p = (typeof(p)) mp->b_rptr;
    switch (p->type) {
    ...
    case T_DISCON_REQ:
        merror(q, mp, EPROTO);
        return 0;
    ...
    }
}
 ...
}

.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR merror ()
can be called from any non-interrupt context, but is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR merror ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
message block.  This is normally the case when
.BR merror ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure and the passed in message pointer is that which
was passed into the procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR merror ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
For the sake of speed,
.BR merror ()
does not check whether the passed in message block was allocated using
.BR esballoc (9).
.BR merror ()
must not be passed such a message block.  Message blocks passed to
.BR merror ()
should be normal message blocks allocated with
.BR allocb (9).

.\"

.BR mexpandb (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR merror ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR merror ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR merror ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Direct allocation and manipulation of the message blocks using standard
.I STREAMS
utility functions should be performed in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR merror ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR merror ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR merror ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
