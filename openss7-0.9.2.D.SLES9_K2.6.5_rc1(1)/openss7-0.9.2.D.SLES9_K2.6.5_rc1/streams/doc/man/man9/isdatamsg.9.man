.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int isdatamsg(mblk_t *" mp ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
the message block to test for data type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tests whether the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
has a data block type.  Data blocks have data type when they are of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
returns true (1) if the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
is of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
returns false (0) if the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
is not of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for protecting the integrity of the passed in message block.

.BR isdatablk (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,

.BR isdatamsg ()
is implemented as an
.BR "extern inline" .
Some implementations, such as
.IR LiS ,
implement
.BR isdatamsg ()
as a macro.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not attempt to take a function pointer reference to
.BR isdatamsg ().
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
