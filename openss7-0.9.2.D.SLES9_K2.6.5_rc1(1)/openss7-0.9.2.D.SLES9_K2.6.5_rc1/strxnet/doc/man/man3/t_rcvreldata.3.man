.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvreldata(int " fd ", struct t_discon *" discon );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint for which to receive orderly release with data.
.TP
.I discon
a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure to contain returned information about the release.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
receives an orderly release indication with disconnect data arriving on the
specified local transport endpoint
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which an orderly release
indication with disconnect data is to be received.
.PP
.I discon
is a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure that returns the disconnect data and disconnect reason.
The
.B t_discon
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_discon {
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int reason;                     /* reason code */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_discon
structure returns the following members and information:
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the user disconnect data associated with the orderly
release indication.
The
.I discon->udata.maxlen
field is significant on call and the
.I discon->udata.len
field is significant on return.
If the
.I discon->udata.maxlen
is zero on call, no user disconnect data will be returned.
If the
.I discon->udata.len
is zero on return, no user disconnect data was provided as part of the orderly
release indication.
.TP
.I reason
the disconnect reason is a transport service provider specific value.
.TP
.I sequence
is not used for
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
and is left unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
is only valid in states
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_OUTREL .
.PP
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
is only supported by transport providers of service type
.B T_COTS_ORD
that have
.B T_ORDRELDATA
set in the
.I flags
field of the
.B t_info
structure in response to
.BR t_open "(3) or " t_getinfo (3).
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
blocks until an orderly release indication is received.  In asynchronous mode
when no orderly release indication is immediately available,
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNOREL .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
returns zero (0) and the user disconnect data and disconnect reason in the
provided
.B t_discon
structure.
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvreldata ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available opaque information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOREL ]
An attempt was made to read an orderly release and no orderly release indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
