.SH NAME
.B putbq, lis_putbq
\- puts a message back on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int putbq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue onto which to put back the messsage.
.TP
.I mp
the message to put back.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putbq ()
places the message pointed to by
.I mp
back onto the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
When the message is placed back on the queue, it is placed on the head of the
queue, rather than the tail of the queue as would result from a call to
.BR putq (9).
The message is placed in the proper order at the head of the priority, normal
or specified band, queue counts are adjusted and queue enabling is performed.
.PP
.BR putbq ()
is normally called from within queue service routines to place a message back
on the queue subsequent to a call to
.BR getq (9)
that removes a message which it turns out cannot be processed at the moment
due to flow restrictions from testing
.BR canput (9)
or
.BR bcanput (9).
When
.BR putbq ()
is executed following
.BR getq (9)
for the same queue, it is guaranteed to succeed.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putbq ()
places the message on the queue and
returns true (1).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putbq ()
returns false (0) and the queue pointed to by
.I q
and the message pointed to by
.I mp
are unaffected.
The caller is retains ownership of the message
.I mp
when the call fails.
.PP
The return value from
.BR putbq ()
should always be examined.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putbq ()
fails if the passed in message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
or, the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
points to a structure other than a queue structure, or refers to a queue that
is closing or for which
put and service routine processing has been
turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putbq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I mp
is unaltered.  It is the caller's responsibility to free
.I mp
if the caller so desires.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putbq ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putbq ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR putbq ()
only fails if a queue band for
.BR mp->b_band
does not yet exist and one could not be allocated.  It can be ensured that
.BR putbq ()
will not fail for the same
.I q
for which the message was obtained with
.BR getq (9).
Otherwise, it can be ensured that the queue band exists by calling
.BR setqstr (9)
for the band in question before calling
.BR putbq ().
.PP
Care should be taken not to return with
.BR putbq ()
a priority message take off of a queue in a service procedure with
.BR getq (9).
This is because placing the priority message back on the queue will cause the
service procedure to re-execute at the earliest opportunity resulting in
possible indefinite looping.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR putq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Versions prior to OpenSS7 release
.B LiS-2.16.18-17
automatically freed the message upon failure.
Versions subsequent to OpenSS7 release
.B LiS-2.16.18-16
do not free the message on failure and the caller retains ownership of the
message in accordance with SVR 4.2 and other implementations.
.PP
.BR putbq ()
still has bugs related to
.BR qprocsoff (9)
handling in that it fails while
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is in effect or if the stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR putbq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
If
.BR putbq ()
is passed an invalid
.IR q " or " mp
argument, the result is undefined.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR putbq ()
fails if the passed in message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
or, the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
points to a structure other than a queue structure, or refers to a queue that
is closing or for which
put and service routine processing has been
turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.IP \(em
.BR putbq ()
only fails if
.I mp->b_band
refers to a non-existent queue band and a queue band structure could not be
allocated.  When
.BR putbq ()
returns failure,
.I mp
is unchanged.
This is consistent with SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI and
.IR Solaris \(rg
documentation.
Under older versions of
.IR LiS ,
regardless of whether
.BR putbq ()
returns success or failure, the message pointed to by
.I mp
is placed on the queue pointed to by
.I q
or freed, so that the caller to
.BR putbq ()
always loses ownership of the message pointed to by
.I mp
upon return from the call.
This is inconsistent with SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI and
.IR Solaris \(rg
documentation.
This is an
.B LiS
bug in older versions of
.BR LiS .
.IP \(em
.BR putbq ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[

.]
do not permit
.BR putbq ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR putbq ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
