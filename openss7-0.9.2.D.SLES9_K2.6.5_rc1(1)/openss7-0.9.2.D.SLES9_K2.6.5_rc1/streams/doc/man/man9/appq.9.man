.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR appq ()
appends the
.I STREAMS
message
.I nmp
just after the message
.I emp
already on queue
.IR q .
If there is no message after
.I emp
in the queue
.IR q ,
or
.I emp
is
.BR NULL ,
this has the same effect as
calling
.BR putq (9)
with
.IR q " and " nmp .
.PP
.BR appq ()
performs all of the normal
.I STREAMS
scheduler functions associated with
.BR putq (9)
including enabling of the queue,
.IR q ,
when the first message or a
high priority
message is placed on the queue.
If queue scheduling has been disabled with
.BR noenable (9),
only
high priority
messages will result in the queue being scheduled.
.\"
.\"
.SS Message Queueing Priority
.PP
.I STREAMS
queues messages based on message queueing priority.  There are three priority classes for messages
that can be tested with
.BR pcmsg (9):
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lllbsss.
1.:\fIHigh Priority\fP:\fC(pcmsg(db_type) != 0 && b_band == 0)\fP
2.:\fINormal Priority\fP:\fC(pcmsg(db_type) == 0 && b_band >= 0)\fP
3.:\fIOrdinary\fP:\fC(pcmsg(db_type) == 0 && b_band == 0)\fP
.TE
.PP
.BR appq ()
only examines the message class and priority band of the first message block of a message.  If a
high priority
message is passed to
.BR appq ()
with a non-zero
.I b_band
value,
.I b_band
is reset to zero
.RB ( 0 )
before placing the message on the queue.
If a
normal priority
message is passed to
.BR appq ()
with
.I b_band
value greater than the number of
.BR qband (9)
structures associated with the queue,
.BR appq ()
attempts to allocate a new
.BR qband (9)
structure for each band up to and including the band of the message.
(But, see
.RI \(lq COMPATIBILTY \(rq,
below.)
.PP
Messages must be placed in order in the queue.  If the message is a
high priority
message, it must be placed on the queue with other
high priority
messages and ahead of
normal priority
and
ordinary
messages.  If the message is a
normal priority
message with a non-zero
.IR b_band,
it must be placed with other messages in the queue band.
If the message is a
ordinary
message (with a zero
.IR b_band ),
it must be placed with other
ordinary
messages, after all other messages.
Attempts to insert a message out of order in the queue with
.BR appq ()
will cause
.BR appq ()
to fail.
.PP
Placing the first message for a queue band onto the queue can result in the allocation of a
.BR qband (9)
structure to provide flow control accounting for the queue band.  Failure to allocate a
.BR qband (9)
structure can cause
.BR appq ()
to fail.  Failure can be avoided by ensuring that a
.BR qband (9)
structure exists for the band,
.IR b_band ,
using
.BR strqget (9)
or
.BR strqset (9).
.PP
Whether a
.BR qband (9)
exists for a given
.I b_band
can be determined by examining the
.I q_nband
member of the
.BR queue (9)
structure.  When
.BR "q_nband\ >=\ b_band" ,
a structure exists; when
.BR "q_nband\ <\ b_band" ,
one needs to be allocated.
.\"
.\"
.SS "Flow Control"
.PP
If a
high priority
message is placed onto the queue, the queue will always be enabled, as with
.BR qenable (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists (and is not already scheduled).
This is true for
.BR appq (),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
and
.BR putbq (9).
Because this is true, a
high priority
message should never be placed back on a queue by the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure with
.BR putbq (9),
otherwise and indefinite loop could result.
.PP
.BR appq ()
is allowed to enable the queue
.RB ( QNOENB
is not set) if the message is a
normal priority
message, or the
.B QWANTR
flag is set indicating that the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is ready to read the queue.
.PP
If a
normal priority
message with a non-zero
.I b_band
is placed onto an empty queue band, the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists (and is not already scheduled) and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If a
ordinary
message with a zero
.I b_band
is placed onto an empty queue and the
.B QWANTR
flag is set for the queue, then the queue will be enabled, as with
.BR enableq (9);
that is, the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will be scheduled if it exists (and is not already scheduled) and the
.B QNOENB
flag has not been set for the queue with
.BR noenable (9).
Another way of putting this is that
.BR appq ()
will enable the queue if the queue is not inhibited with
.BR noenable (9)
and one of the following conditions also holds true:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The driver or module has just been opened for the first time: that is, the queue is empty and has
always been empty.
.IP \(bu
.BR getq (9)
found no message queued on its last call and no message has been queued since.
.PP
When an ordinary message is enqueued by
.BR appq (),
it will cause the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure to be scheduled only if the queue was previously empty, and a previous
.BR getq (9)
call returns
.B NULL
(that is, the
.B QWANTR
flag is set).  If there are messages on the queue,
.BR appq ()
presumes that the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is blocked by flow control and the procedure will be rescheduled by
.I STREAMS
when the block is removed.
.PP
As a general rule for
.BR appq (),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
and
.BR putbq (9),
the queue is enabled whenever the message placed on the message queue becomes the
first message on the queue, unless the message is a
normal priority
message and the queue has been disabled with
.BR noenable (9),
or the message was placed with
.BR putbq (9).
.\".PP
.\".BR appq ()
.\"only looks at the priority band of the first message block.  If a
.\"high priority
.\"message is passed to
.\".BR appq ()
.\"with a non-zero

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR appq ()
is an
.IR LiS -specific
function that should not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Instead, the driver or modules should use the
.I DDI/DKI
defined
.BR insq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR appq ()
returns true (1) and the message pointed to by
.I mp
has been appended into the queue.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR appq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I mp
remains unaltered.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR appq ()
fails silently if
.I nmp
is associated with a non-existent queue band and a queue band structure could not be
allocated.  This error can be avoided by assuring that a queue band structure
exists with
.BR strqset (9)
before the call to
.BR appq ()
is made with a banded
.IR nmp .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR appq ()
can be called from any context, including process context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks,
soft interrupts, and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR appq ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the passed in queue and message pointers, and
exclusive access to the passed in messages.
.\"
.SS Validity of \fIq\fP
.PP
The caller is responsible for the validity of the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q .
.I q
is valid from all procedures synchronous on
.IR q ,
including
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
procedures and synchronous callback functions.
.PP
For process context, asynchronous callback functions, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service
routines, that is, when calling
.BR appq ()
from a
.RI non- STREAMS
context, any valid queue pointer,
.IR q ,
can be passed to
.BR appq ();
however, the caller must ensure that the queue pointer remains valid across the call.
In general,
.I q
is valid from the moment that
.BR qprocson (9)
returns until the moment that
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is called, so, if the
.RI non- STREAMS
code sections are passed a pointer from
.IR q 's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure and invalidated by its
.IR qi_qclose ()
procedure, validity can be ensured.  (This is the case with
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR bufcall (9)
asynchronous callbacks.  These callbacks are passed a queue pointer only after
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and must be cancelled before
.IR qi_qclose (9)
returns.)
.PP
Otherwise, from outside of
.I STREAMS
context, it is still possible to derive a queue pointer from a validated queue pointer, provided that
the
Stream 
is frozen with a call to
.BR freezestr (9).
Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@",
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
it is permissible to call
.BR appq ()
on a
Stream
that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
and
.BR freezestr (9)
can be called from any context.
.BR appq ()
takes a recursive freeze lock that can be acquired by the caller when the
Stream
is frozen.  If another thread has the
Stream
frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
the calling processor will spin until the
Stream
is thawed by the other thread with
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.\".PP
.\".BR appq ()
.\"is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure validity of the passed in message pointers and
.\"exclusive access to the messages they reference.
.\"On uniprocessor systems, it may be sufficient to block interrupts to ensure the validity of, and
.\"exclusive access to,
.\".IR emp ;
.\"for both uniprocessor and symmetric multi-processor systems, it is safer to use
.\".BR freezestr (9).
.\"
.SS Validity and Exclusion for \fIemp\fP
.PP
Ensuring validity and exclusion for
.I emp
is difficult on SMP systems, because concurrent calls to
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
can change
.I emp->b_next
and
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband (9),
can change
.I emp->b_prev
and invalidate a previous
.I emp
pointer dereference (e.g., by removing the message from the queue and freeing it).
.PP
Validity and exclusion for
.I emp
on both UP and SMP systems can be readily ensured by freezing the queue,
.IR q ,
using
.BR freezestr (9)
before referencing
.IR emp ,
and across the call to
.BR appq ().
However, it is also possible to ensure validity and exclusion with
.BR qwriter (9),
.BR streams_put (9),
with appropriate synchronization boundaries
.RB ( STR_PERQUEUE " or " D_MTPERQ ),
or with module private locks.
Because freezing the Stream is not the only way to provide the necessary assurances,
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
does not require that the Stream be frozen by the caller, although it is recommended.
.PP
Similar synchronization is necessary for the use of
.BR appq (),
.BR insq (9),
and
.BR rmvq (9).
.PP
.BR appq ()
protects its dereferencing of the
.I emp->b_next
pointer with the queue write lock, making it safe to be called concurrent with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband (9),
.BR rmvq (9)
or a concurrent call to
.BR appq ().
.\"
.SS Validity and Exclusion for \fInmp\fP
.PP
Validity of the
.I nmp
pointer and exclusive access to the message pointed to by
.I nmp
is normally assured in the usual ways:  If
.I nmp
was just allocated using
.BR allocb (9)
or
.BR esballoc (9),
or,
if
.I nmp
was just removed from a message queue with
.BR getq (9)
or
.BR rmvq (9),
then exclusion and validity is assured.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION

except that the

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.BR appq ()
is compatible with

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
When a banded message (a

message, with a non-zero
.IR b_band )
is placed on a queue with
.BR putq (9),

.BR appq ()
tries to allocate

structures for all non-existent bands up to and including the band of the message
and places the resulting

structures into a reverse sorted

All versions of
.I LiS
contain the bug that they keep track of message queue counts,
.IR q_count ,
.IR qb_count ,
in terms of the sum of the absolute sizes of the data buffers referenced by message blocks,
.RB ( "db_lim - db_base" ),
and not the sizes of the message blocks themselves,
.RB ( "b_wptr - b_rptr" ),
which does not conform to
.IR "SVR 4.2 STREAMS" .
