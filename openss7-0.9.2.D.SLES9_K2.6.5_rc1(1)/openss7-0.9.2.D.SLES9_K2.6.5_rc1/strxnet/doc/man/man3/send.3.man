.SH NAME
.B send
\- send a message on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "ssize_t send(int " socket ", const void *" buffer ", size_t " length ", int " flags );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.TP
.I socket
Specifies the socket file descriptor.
.TP
.I buffer
Points to the buffer containing the message to send.
.TP
.I length
Specifies the length of the message in bytes.
.TP
.I flags
Specifies the type of message transmission. Values of this argument are formed
by logically OR'ing zero or more of the following flags:
.RS
.TP
.B MSG_EOR
Terminates a record (if supported by the protocol)
.TP
.B MSG_OOB
Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support out-of-band communications. The
significance and semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.
.RE
.PP
The
.BR send ()
function initiates transmission of a message from the specified
socket to its peer. The
.BR send ()
function sends a message only when the socket
is connected (including when the peer of a connectionless socket has been set
via
.BR connect (3)).
.PP
The length of the message to be sent is specified by the
.I length
argument. If
the message is too long to pass through the underlying protocol,
.BR send ()
fails
and no data is transmitted.
.PP
Successful completion of a call to
.BR send ()
does not guarantee delivery of the
message. A return value of -1 indicates only locally-detected errors.
.PP
If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be
transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not have
.B O_NONBLOCK
set,
.BR send ()
blocks until space is available. If space is not available at the
sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file
descriptor does have
.B O_NONBLOCK
set,
.BR send ()
will fail. The
.BR select (2)
and
.BR poll (2)
functions can be used to determine when it is possible to send more
data.
.PP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to
use the
.BR send ()
function.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The
.BR send ()
function is identical to
.BR sendto (3)
with a null pointer dest_len
argument, and to
.BR write (2)
if no
.I flags
are used.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR send ()
returns the number of bytes sent.
Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR send ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN "] or [" EWOULDBLOCK ]
The socket's file descriptor is marked
.B O_NONBLOCK
and the
requested operation would block.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
The
.I socket
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ ECONNRESET ]
A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
.TP
.RB [ EDESTADDRREQ ]
The socket is not connection-mode and no peer address is set.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The
.I buffer
parameter can not be accessed.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal interrupted
.BR send ()
before any data was transmitted.
.TP
.RB [ EMSGSIZE ]
The message is too large be sent all at once, as the socket
requires.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTCONN ]
The socket is not connected or otherwise has not had the peer
prespecified.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSOCK ]
The
.I socket
argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The
.I socket
argument is associated with a socket that does not
support one or more of the values set in
.IR flags .
.TP
.RB [ EPIPE ]
The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is
connection-mode and is no longer connected. In the latter case,
and if the socket is of type
.BR SOCK_STREAM ,
the
.B SIGPIPE
signal is
generated to the calling process.
.PP
The
.BR send ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
The calling process does not have the appropriate privileges.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
system.
.TP
.RB [ ENETDOWN ]
The local interface used to reach the destination is down.
.TP
.RB [ ENETUNREACH ]
No route to the network is present.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform
the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient
.IR STREAMS (4)
resources available for the
operation to complete.
