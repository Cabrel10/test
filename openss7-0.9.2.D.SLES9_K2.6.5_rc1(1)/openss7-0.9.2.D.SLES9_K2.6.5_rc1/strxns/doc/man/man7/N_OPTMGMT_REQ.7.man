.SH NAME
.B N_OPTMGMT_REQ, N_optmgmt_req_t
\- network options management request
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive allows the NS user to manage the QOS parameter values
associated with the stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, and its structure is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;		/* always N_OPTMGMT_REQ */
    ulong QOS_length;		/* length of QOS values */
    ulong QOS_offset;		/* offset of QOS values */
    ulong OPTMGMT_flags;	/* default receipt conf.
				   selection */
} N_optmgmt_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.FI
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I QOS_length
Indicates the length of the default values of the QOS parameters as selected
by the NS user.  In the connection-mode environment these values will be used
in subsequent
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7)
primitives on the stream that do not specify values for these QOS parameters.
In the connection-less environment, these values represent the selected QOS
values that would apply to each unit data transmission.  If the NS user cannot
determine the value of a QOS parameter, its value should be set to
.BR QOS_UNKNOWN .
If the NS user does not specify any QOS parameter values, the length of this
field should be set to zero.

.TP
.I QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of
the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I OPTMGMT_flags
.RS

.TP
.B DEFAULT_RC_SEL
When set, it indicates to the NS provider that the NS user's default selection
is for the use of receipt confirmation with every
.BR N_DATA_REQ (7)
message (applicable only when its use is successfully negotiated via the
.B N_CONN
primitives).  This default indication is used only when the
.B M_PROTO
message block is not present in the
.BR N_DATA_REQ (7)
primitive.  This flag should be ignored in the connection-less environment.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in the
.B NS_IDLE
state.
.RE
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state is
.BR NS_WACK_OPTREQ .
.SH RESPONSE
The 
.BR N_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive requires the NS provider to generate one of the following
acknowledgeents upon receipt of the primitive:
.IP \- 4
.B Successful:
Acknowledgment is via the
.BR N_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  At successful completion, the resulting state is NS_IDLE
.IP \-
.B Non-fatal errors:
These errors are indicated in the
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.The resulting state remains unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.TP
.RB [ NOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSPARAM ]
The QOS parameter values specified are outside the range supported by the NS
provider.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSTYPE ]
he QOS structure type is not supported by the NS provider.
.TP
.RB [ NSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
primitive.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
