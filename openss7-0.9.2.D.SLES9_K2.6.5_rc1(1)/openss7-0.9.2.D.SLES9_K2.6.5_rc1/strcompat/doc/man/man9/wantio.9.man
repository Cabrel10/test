.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _AIX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int wantio(queue_t *" q ", struct wantio *" w );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
The driver queue pointer calling the function.
.TP
.I w
a pointer to a
.B wantio
structure that contains the IO functions to call directly from the stream
head.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When
.I w
is
.RB non- NULL ,
.BR wantio ()
installs the direct IO functions specified in the 
.B wantio
structure pointed to by
.I w
into the stream head associated with the driver queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
When
.I w
is
.BR NULL ,
.BR wantio ()
removes any direct IO functions installed by a previous call to
.BR wantio ().
.PP
The
.B wantio
structure is formatted as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct wantio {
	unsigned int (*poll)();
	ssize_t (*read)();
	ssize_t (*write)();
	ssize_t (*readv)();
	ssize_t (*writev)();
	ssize_t (*sendpage)();
	int (*getpmsg)();
	int (*putpmsg)();
};
\s+2\fP
.fi
.TP \w'getpmsg()\(em'u
.IR poll ()
A pointer to a poll procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no poll procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
poll file operation.
.TP
.IR read ()
A pointer to a read procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no read procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
read file operation.
.TP
.IR write ()
A pointer to a write procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no write procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
write file operation.
.TP
.IR readv ()
A pointer to a readv procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no readv procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
readv file operation.
.TP
.IR writev ()
A pointer to a writev procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no writev procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
writev file operation.
.TP
.IR sendpage ()
A pointer to a sendpage procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no sendpage procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
sendpage file operation.
.TP
.IR getpmsg ()
A pointer to a getpmsg procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no getpmsg procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
getpmsg file operation.
.TP
.IR putpmsg ()
A pointer to a putpmsg procedure for direct I/O or
.B NULL
if no putpmsg procedure is specified.
The prototype for this function is the same as the
.B Linux
putpmsg file operation.
.PP
When the
.B wantio
structure is provided to the
.BR wantio ()
call, each
.RB non- NULL
element of the
.B wantio
structure will be used instead of the corresponding element in the file operations for the stream
head.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR wantio ()
is useful for
.I STREAMS
drivers that need direct I/O operations for efficiency or other special applications.  Zero-copy
write operations can be accomplished by replacing the
.BR sendpage ()
file operation which is invoked by
.BR sendfile (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR wantio ()
always returns zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR wantio ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR wantio ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR wantio ()
is MP-safe and neither takes nor releases locks.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR wantio ()
is a
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _AIX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE
defined.
.PP
Before calling
.BR wantio ()
for an active stream,
the following steps should be performed by the driver:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
Send a
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9)
message upstream with a
.B strlp
structure in the message.  The
.B strlp
structure is formatted as follows:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct strlp {
        int lp_count;
        queue_t *lp_queue;
};
\s+2\fP
.fi
.TP \w'lp_count\(em'u
.I lp_count
Initially set to zero by the driver, this count is incremented by each module
that recognizes the
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9)
message type and will permit direct IO to the driver.  Once the
.BR M_LETSPLAY (9)
message reaches the stream head, the stream head compares this count with the
number of modules pushed on the stream.  If the two are equal, the stream head
returns an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message.  If the two are different, the stream head returns an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
message.
.TP
.I lp_queue
A pointer to the driver's write queue.
.RE
.IP ""
When an intervening module receives an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message, it delivers all queued data as
.BR M_BACKWASH (9)
messages, and any
.BR M_BACKWASH (9)
messages received from upstream,
and sends the
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message downstream.
In this way, all queue data is delivered to the driver's write queue as
.BR M_BACKWASH (9)
messages followed by a
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message.
.IP (2)
Wait for an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
or
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message received on the write queue.
.IP (3)
If an
.BR M_DONTPLAY (9)
message is received, the driver cannot call
.BR wantio ().
.IP (4)
If an
.BR M_BACKDONE (9)
message is received, the driver can handle any
.BR M_BACKWASH (9)
messages representing pushed data and call
.BR wantio ().

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR wantio ()

.BR wantio ()
is compatible with

with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR wantio ()
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function and it should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
The
.B wantio
structure does not appear in
.IR AIX \(rg
documentation.
Therefore, the
.B wantio
structure bears no resemblance to that of
.IR AIX \(rg.
Because of structural differences, source-level compatibility with
.IR AIX \(rg
is not guaranteed.
.IP \(em
The
.B strlp
structure does not appear in
.IR AIX \(rg
documentation.
Therefore, the
.B strlp
structure described above bears no resemblance to that of
.IR AIX \(rg.
