This is the OpenSS7 Release of the @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, drivers and modules
used with the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} or
@cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use
it.} SVR 4.2 STREAMS releases.

The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} tools, headers, drivers and modules from the @cite{Linux
STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
package for use with both @cite{Linux STREAMS}@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported
and deprecated.  Do not use it.} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in preparation for replacement of the
former by the later.

The following sections provide information on @value{PACKAGE_TITLE} releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to mainstream UNIX releases of the core, modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

When installing from the tarball (@pxref{Installing the Tar Ball}), this distribution is probably
compatible with a  much broader array of distributions than those listed above.  These are the
distributions against which the current maintainer creates and tests builds.

@node Linux Kernel
@subsection Kernel
@cindex Kernel

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package compiles as a @dfn{Linux} kernel module.  It is not
necessary to patch the @dfn{Linux} kernel to build or use the package.@footnote{At a later date, it
is possible to move this package into the kernel, however, with continued resistance to STREAMS from
within the @dfn{Linux} developer community, this is currently unlikely.} Nor do you have to
recompile your kernel to build or use the package.  OpenSS7 packages use @command{autoconf} scripts
to adapt the package source to your existing kernel.  The package builds and runs nicely against
production kernels from the distributions listed above.  Rather than relying on kernel versions, the
@command{autoconf} scripts interrogate the kernel for specific features and variants to better adapt
to distribution production kernels that have had patches applied over the official
@url{http://www.kernel.org/, kernel.org} sources.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10 and has
been tested up to and including 2.4.27.  It has been tested from 2.6.3 up to and including 2.6.17.
Please note that your mileage may vary if you use a kernel more recent than 2.6.17: it is difficult
to anticipate changes that kernel developers will make in the future.  Many kernels in the 2.6
series now vary widely ny release version and if you encounter problems, try a kernel within the
supported series.

UP validation testing for kernels is performed on all supported architectures.  SMP validation
testing is performed on UP machines, as well as on an Intel 3.0GHz Pentium IV 630 with
HyperThreading enabled.  Because HyperThreading is not as independent as multiple CPUs, SMP
validation testing is limited.

@node Linux Architectures
@subsection Architectures
@cindex Architectures

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package compiles and installs on a wide range of architectures.
Although it is believed that the package will work on all architectures supported by the Linux
kernel being used, validation testing has only been performed with the following architectures:

@itemize
@item ix86
@item x86_64
@item ppc (MPC 860)
@item ppc64
@end itemize

32-bit compatibility validation testing is performed on all 64-bit architectures supporting 32-bit
compatibility.  If you would like to validate an OpenSS7 package on a specific machine architecture,
you are welcome to sponsor the project with a test machine.

@node Linux STREAMS
@subsection Linux STREAMS
@cindex Linux STREAMS

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with
@cite{Linux STREAMS},@footnote{@cite{Linux STREAMS} is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.}
however, to use the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package with @cite{LiS} requires use of the OpenSS7
release packages of @cite{LiS}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{LiS-2.18.3} release that
is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.
But, do not use @cite{LiS}: it is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Use @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
instead.

@node Linux Fast-STREAMS
@subsection Linux Fast-STREAMS
@cindex Linux Fast-STREAMS

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is currently compatible with @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS
(LfS)}.
The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with the OpenSS7 @b{streams-0.7a.6} release
that is available from the @url{http://www.openss7.org/download.html, The OpenSS7 Project Downloads
Page}.

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.8
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.8
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.8

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2), architectures (x86_64, SMP,
32-bit compatibility), recent Linux distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels
(2.6.15).

This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle __LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and
2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing list.  Corrects one bug from inspection.

@itemize
@item Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to support 32-bit ioctl
compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.  Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At
the same time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of the IO controls for the
ldl(4) driver has been added.
@item Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.
@item Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on x86_64 architecture.
Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2 compiler warnings.
@item Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on mailing list.
@item Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630 Hyper-Threaded SMP on
x86_64.  This package should now run well on N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.
@item Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on x86_64.  Should apply well to
other 64-bit architectures as well.
@end itemize

This is a public gamma release of the package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.7
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.7
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.7

This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified (conformance test suite
passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS (streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated
because LiS was not operating correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error contrary to
POSIX).

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.6
@subsection Release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.6
@cindex release @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2.6

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream version only to be consistent
with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All @cite{RPM} release numbers will be
@samp{-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)} and all @cite{Debian} release numbers will be @samp{_0}.  If you wish
to apply patches and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave @cite{Debian} release number @samp{_1} reserved for
your use, so you can still bundle the source in the @file{.dsc} file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels and popular distributions
based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider distribution support.  The package also supports both
@file{LiS-2.18.1} as well as @file{streams-0.7a} on both kernels.

Removed @cite{XNS} kernel modules, header files and documentation to a separate
@file{strxns-0.9.2-1} package and @cite{INET} kernel modules, header files and documentation to a
separate @file{strinet-0.9.2-1} package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-5
@subsection @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-5
@cindex @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-5

Dropped RPM epoch to 0 from 1 in preparation for RPM release.  Bumped RPM release to 5.

Minor corrections: made @cite{SCTP} manpages conditional on @cite{OpenSS7 SCTP} kernel.

Updated documentation and provided improvements to build process applied to other packages.  This
includes improvements to creation of @file{info} and @file{pdf} manuals.  Update @command{tirdwr}
and @command{timod} manpage.

Removed INET package from @file{@value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-5} release.  This has now been moved to the
@file{strxns-0.9.2}@footnote{@xref{Top, About This Manual, About This Manual, strxns, OpenSS7 XNS
Networking Installation and Reference Manual}.} package.  Removed XNS header files and manual pages
for CDI, DLPI and NPI to that package.  Also removed @command{test-inet_raw},
@command{test-inet_udp} and @command{test-inet_tcp} test programs to that package.  Removed
@file{/dev/inet} driver to that package.  Stripped out the -dev- RPM subpackage as there are no
devices left in the package.  Adjusted the virtual package provides naming to a more rational
approach.  Adjusted kernel module installation process to accomodate.

Genksyms now generates kernels symbols for all combinations of SMP and @var{CONFIG_REGPARM} kernels
allowing a single modversions header file.  Improved manpages @command{automake} file fragment
(@file{am/man.am}) to accomodate top-level manual pages (this was really for the @file{netperf}
release).

@node @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-4
@subsection @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-4
@cindex @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-4

Changes to compile, install.  Now builds rpms for @cite{Fedora Core 1 (FC1)}, @cite{Whitebox
Enterprise Linux (WBEL)} and @cite{RedHat Enterprise Linux (EL3)}.

Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in @file{.spec} file for RPM versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2
and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and moved @command{getpmsg} and @command{putpmsg} manual
pages.

Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during non-rpm @command{autoconf}
installation.

Correction to zero maxlen behavior in @command{t_rcvconnect()}.

@node @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-3
@subsection @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-3
@cindex @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-3

Added check for @var{CONFIG_REGPARM}, addition of @command{-mregparm=3} @var{CFLAGS}, addition of
@samp{regparm_} prefix for exported kernel symbols.

Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and caching of detected kernel
symbols.

Added an option for suppression of exported symbol versioning (@command{--without-modversions}).

@node @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-2
@subsection @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-2
@cindex @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-2

A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed order of build in
@samp{make rebuild} target to build tools last so that the rpm debug package is build correctly on
@cite{RedHat 9}.

Changed @var{MODULE_PARM} to static so that @samp{make install-strip} does not strip module
parameter symbols.

@node @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1
@subsection @value{PACKAGE}-0.9.2-1

@node Pre-Alpha Releases
@subsection Pre-Alpha Releases

@dfn{Pre-alpha} releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documenation available for insepection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

@dfn{Pre-alpha} release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

@node Alpha Releases
@subsection Alpha Releases

@dfn{Alpha} release are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an @dfn{alpha} release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an earily release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

@dfn{Alpha} release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

@node Beta Releases
@subsection Beta Releases

@dfn{Beta} releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  @dfn{Beta} release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
respolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a @dfn{beta} release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

@dfn{Beta} release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

@node Gamma Releases
@subsection Gamma Releases

@dfn{Gamma} release are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  @dfn{Gamma} release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Gamma} release packages typically resolve problems in previous @dfn{beta} releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project}
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

@node Production Releases
@subsection Production Releases

@dfn{Production} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  @dfn{Production} release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Production} packages ship containig a list of validated distributions and architecutres.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.
