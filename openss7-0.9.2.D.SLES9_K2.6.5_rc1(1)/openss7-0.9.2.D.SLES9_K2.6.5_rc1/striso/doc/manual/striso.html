This version of  <samp><span class="command">striso</span></samp> is a version modified by
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/">The OpenSS7 Project</a> that contains drivers and modules previously
part of <cite>Linux STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  In stark contrast to many other software packages released by
<a href="http://www.openss7.org/">The OpenSS7 Project</a>, this package contains code mostly developed by
other parties.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Overview</h3>

<p><a name="index-overview-7"></a>
This manual documents the design, implementation, installation, operation and future development of
the OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.

   <p>The OpenSS7 ISO Stack package is
a STREAMS ISO Networking (ISO)
package for Linux that can be used with
<cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
or
<cite>Linux STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
It includes development tools, header files and manual pages for

     <ul>
<li><cite>Communications Device Interface (CDI)</cite>,
<li><cite>Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)</cite> and
<li><cite>Network Provider Interface (NPI)</cite>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In addition, it provides STREAMS drivers and modules for DLPI including:

     <ul>
<li>Linux IP to DLPI Driver (<samp><span class="file">streams-ldl.o</span></samp>),
<li>DLPI to Linux IP Driver (<samp><span class="file">streams-ip_to_dlpi.o</span></samp>), and
<li>DLPI to Linux IP Module (<samp><span class="file">streams-ip_strm_mod.o</span></samp>). 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The OpenSS7 ISO Stack package is essential to the development and support of
STREAMS ISO networking
modules and drivers and provides a fundamental set of
X/Open
header files and manual pages for such development.

   <p>The OpenSS7 ISO Stack does <em>not</em> provide the
X/Open Transport Interface (XTI), Transport
Provider Interface (TPI) or Transport Layer Interface (TLI) components.  See the OpenSS7
<samp><span class="command">strxnet</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
and
<samp><span class="command">strinet</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>

<p><a name="index-drivers-13"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Linux IP to DLPI Driver (ldl)</h4>

<p>The LDL driver sits atop any existing Linux IP interface driver and presents a
DLPI interface to the STREAMS drivers above.  This allows any STREAMS driver
that communicates downstream using DLPI to utilize the services of existing
Linux drivers for Ethernet, Token Ring, etc.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Licensing</h5>

<p>The LDL driver and the <samp><span class="command">ldltest</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ldlconfig</span></samp> programs were
originally written by Ole Husgaard and is licensed under the GNU General
Public License, See <a href="#GNU-General-Public-License">GNU General Public License</a>.  This OpenSS7 release of the LDL driver also
includes Hewlett-Packard proposed patches. 
An OpenSS7 GPL header has been added to the source code files to make this
clear.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 DLPI to Linux IP Driver (ip_to_dlpi)</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Licensing</h5>

<p>The ip_to_dlpi driver was originally written by <cite>The Software Group
Limited</cite> and in licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License See <a href="#LGPL">LGPL</a>. 
Nevertheless, this OpenSS7 release of the <samp><span class="file">ip_to_dlpi</span></samp> driver is released

<p><a name="index-modules-14"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 DLPI to Linux IP Module (ip_strm_mod)</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Licensing</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="file">ip_strm_mod</span></samp> module was originally written by Mikel L. Mathews and is licensed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License See <a href="#LGPL">LGPL</a>.  However, this OpenSS7 release is distributed under
the GNU General Public License See <a href="#GNU-General-Public-License">GNU General Public License</a>.  An OpenSS7 GPL header has been added to the source code
to make this clear.

   <p>LiS includes two adapter drivers to assist in interfacing STREAMS drivers to the Linux Kernel's
TCP/IP protocols.  One driver, <dfn>ip_strm_mod</dfn> acts as an IP interface driver.  It fits below IP
using standard <samp><span class="command">ifconfig</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a> procedures.  It, in turn, communicates downstream with any STREAMS driver using
the DLPI protocol in a fashion similar to the manner in which IP on Unix systems interfaces to lower
interface drivers.  This allows a DLPI STREAMS driver to act as an interface driver to Linux TCP/IP.

<p>This is the OpenSS7 Release of the OpenSS7 ISO Stack tools, drivers and modules
used with the <cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite> or
<cite>Linux STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
SVR 4.2 STREAMS releases.

   <p>The purpose of providing a separate release of this package was to separate the
OpenSS7 ISO Stack tools, headers, drivers and modules from the
<cite>Linux STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
package for use with both
<cite>Linux STREAMS</cite><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a>
and <cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite> in preparation for replacement of the former by the later.

   <p>The following sections provide information on OpenSS7 ISO Stack releases as well as
compatibility information of OpenSS7 release to the original GCOM releases of these modules and
drivers, as well as Linux kernel compatibility.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.1 GNU/Linux Distributions</h4>

<p><a name="index-GNU_002fLinux-Distributions-21"></a>
<dfn>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</dfn> is compatible with the following <dfn>Linux</dfn>
distributions:<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a>

     <ul>

</ul>

   <p>When installing from the tarball (see <a href="#Installing-the-Tar-Ball">Installing the Tar Ball</a>), this distribution is probably
compatible with a  much broader array of distributions than those listed above.  These are the
distributions against which the current maintainer creates and tests builds.

<p><a name="Linux-Kernel"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.2 Kernel</h4>

<p><a name="index-Kernel-22"></a>
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package compiles as a <dfn>Linux</dfn> kernel module.  It is not
necessary to patch the <dfn>Linux</dfn> kernel to build or use the package.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Nor do you have to
recompile your kernel to build or use the package.  OpenSS7 packages use <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> scripts
to adapt the package source to your existing kernel.  The package builds and runs nicely against
production kernels from the distributions listed above.  Rather than relying on kernel versions, the
<samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> scripts interrogate the kernel for specific features and variants to better adapt
to distribution production kernels that have had patches applied over the official
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a> sources.

   <p>The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10 and has
been tested up to and including 2.4.27.  It has been tested from 2.6.3 up to and including 2.6.15.

   <p>UP validation testing for kernels is performed on all supported architectures.  SMP validation
testing is performed on UP machines, as well as on an Intel 3.0GHz Pentium IV 630 with
HyperThreading enabled.  Because HyperThreading is not as independent as multiple CPUs, SMP
validation testing is limited.

<p><a name="Linux-Architectures"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.3 Architectures</h4>

<p><a name="index-Architectures-23"></a>
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package compiles and installs on a wide range of architectures. 
Although it is believed that the package will work on all architectures supported by the Linux
kernel being used, validation testing has only been performed with the following architectures:

     <ul>
<li>ix86
<li>x86_64
<li>ppc (MPC 860)
<li>ppc64
</ul>

   <p>32-bit compatibility validation testing is performed on all 64-bit architectures supporting 32-bit
compatibility.  If you would like to validate an OpenSS7 package on a specific machine architecture,
you are welcome to sponsor the project with a test machine.

<p><a name="Linux-STREAMS"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.4 Linux STREAMS</h4>

<p><a name="index-Linux-STREAMS-24"></a>
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package is currently compatible with
<cite>Linux STREAMS</cite>,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a>
however, to use the <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package with <cite>LiS</cite> requires use of the OpenSS7
release packages of <cite>LiS</cite>. 
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package is compatible with the OpenSS7 <b>LiS-2.18.3</b> release that
is available from the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/download.html">The OpenSS7 Project Downloads Page</a>. 
But, do not use <cite>LiS</cite>: it is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Use <cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite>
instead.

<p><a name="Linux-Fast-STREAMS"></a>
<a name="Linux-Fast_002dSTREAMS"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.5 Linux Fast-STREAMS</h4>

<p><a name="index-Linux-Fast_002dSTREAMS-25"></a>
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package is currently compatible with <cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS
(LfS)</cite>. 
The <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package is compatible with the OpenSS7 <b>streams-0.7a.4</b> release
that is available from the <a href="http://www.openss7.org/download.html">The OpenSS7 Project Downloads Page</a>.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Release Notes</h3>

<p><a name="index-release-notes-26"></a>
The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the <br>
OpenSS7 ISO Stack package.

<!--  -->
<p><a name="Release-striso-0.9.2.1.rc2"></a>
<a name="Release-striso_002d0_002e9_002e2_002e1_002erc2"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 Release striso-0.9.2.1.rc2</h4>

<p><a name="index-release-_0040value_007bPACKAGE_007d_002d_0040value_007bVERSION_007d-27"></a>
Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the <samp><span class="command">striso</span></samp> release.

   <p>This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<p><a name="Maturity"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.4 Maturity</h3>

<p><a name="index-maturity-28"></a>
The <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> adheres to the following release philosophy:

     <ul>
<li>pre-alpha release
<li>alpha release
<li>beta release
<li>gamma release
<li>production release
</ul>

<p><a name="Pre-Alpha-Releases"></a>
<a name="Pre_002dAlpha-Releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Pre-Alpha Releases</h4>

<p><dfn>Pre-alpha</dfn> releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documenation available for insepection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

   <p><dfn>Pre-alpha</dfn> release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

<p><a name="Alpha-Releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Alpha Releases</h4>

<p><dfn>Alpha</dfn> release are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an <dfn>alpha</dfn> release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an earily release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

   <p><dfn>Alpha</dfn> release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

<p><a name="Beta-Releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 Beta Releases</h4>

<p><dfn>Beta</dfn> releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  <dfn>Beta</dfn> release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
respolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a <dfn>beta</dfn> release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

   <p><dfn>Beta</dfn> release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

<p><a name="Gamma-Releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.4 Gamma Releases</h4>

<p><dfn>Gamma</dfn> release are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  <dfn>Gamma</dfn> release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

   <p><dfn>Gamma</dfn> release packages typically resolve problems in previous <dfn>beta</dfn> releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   <dfn>The OpenSS7 Project</dfn>
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

<p><a name="Production-Releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.5 Production Releases</h4>

<p><dfn>Production</dfn> releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  <dfn>Production</dfn> release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

   <p><dfn>Production</dfn> packages ship containig a list of validated distributions and architecutres. 
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.

<p><a name="Downloading"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Downloading</h3>

<p><a name="index-downloading-35"></a>
The OpenSS7 ISO Stack package releases can be downloaded from the downloads
page of <a href="http://www.openss7.org/download.html">The OpenSS7 Project</a>.  The
package is available as a binary RPM (for popular architectures) a source RPM,
Debian binary DEB and source DSC, or as a tar ball.  If you are using a
browsable viewer, you can obtain the OpenSS7 release of
<samp><span class="command">striso</span></samp> from the links in the sections that follow.

   <p>By far the easiest form for installing and using
<samp><span class="command">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2</span></samp> is to download and install binary RPM. 
If a binary RPM is not available for your distribution,  but your distribution
supports RPM, the next best method for installing and using
<samp><span class="command">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2</span></samp> is to download and rebuild the source
RPM.  If your architecture does not support RPM at all, or you have special
needs (such as cross-compiling for embedded targets), the final resort method is
to download, configure, build and install from the source tarball.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Downloading the Binary RPM</h4>

<p><a name="index-downloading_002c-binary-rpms-36"></a><a name="index-binary-rpms-37"></a>
To install from binary RPM, you will need several of the RPM for a complete
installation.  Binary RPM fall into several categories.  To download and install a
complete package requires the appropriate RPM from each of the several categories
below, as applicable.  Some release packages do not provide RPMs in each of the
several categories.

   <p>To install from Binary RPM, you will need all of the following kernel
indepdendent packages for your architecture, and one of the kernel-depdendent
packages from the next section.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Independent RPM</h5>

<p>Independent RPM are
dependent on neither the Linux kernel version, nor the STREAMS package. 
For example, the
source package
`<samp><span class="samp">striso-source-0.9.2.1.rc2-1.FC5.noarch.rpm</span></samp>',
is not dependent on
kernel nor STREAMS package.

<p class="noindent">All of the following kernel and STREAMS independent RPM are required for your architecture. 
Binary RPMs listed here are for example only: additional binary RPMs are
available from the downloads site.  If your architecture is not available, you
can build binary RPM from the source RPM (see see <a href="#Building-from-the-Source-RPM">Building from the Source RPM</a>).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Kernel-Dependent DEB</h5>

<p>Kernel-Dependent DEB are dependent on specific Linux Kernel Binary DEB releases. 
Packages are provided for popular released <cite>RedHat</cite> kernels.  Packages
dependent upon <cite>RedHat</cite> or other kernel DEB will have the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>'

   <p>One of the following Kernel-Dependent packages is required for your architecture

you can build binary DEB from the source DEB (see see <a href="#Building-from-the-Debian-DSC">Building from the Debian DSC</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-33" name="fnd-33"><sup>33</sup></a>

If you are a subscriber or sponsor of <a href="http://www.openss7.org/">The OpenSS7 Project</a> with CVS archive access privileges then you can download release or
mid-release versions of the <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> package from the project
CVS archive.

   <p>The OpenSS7 ISO Stack package is located in the <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp>

<a href="#Releases">Releases</a>.

   <p>To access the archive from the project CVS pserver, use the following commands

   <p>It is, of course, possible to check out by date or by other criteria.  For more
information, see <a href="*manpages*.html#cvs_00281_0029">cvs(1)</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Preparing the CVS Working Directory</h5>

<p>Although public releases of the <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> package do not
require reconfiguration, creating a configurable directory from the CVS archive
requires tools not normally distributed with the other releases.

   <p>The build host requires the following GNU tools:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="command">autoconf 2.59</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">automake 1.9.6</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">libtool 1.5.22</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">gettext 0.14.5</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>It should be stressed that, in particular, the <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp> must be at version releases <samp><span class="command">2.59</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">1.9</span></samp>. 
<em>The versions normally distributed in mainstream GNU/Linux distributions
are, in fact, much older than these versions.</em><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-43" name="fnd-43"><sup>43</sup></a>  GNU version of these packages configured and installed to default
directories will install in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/</span></samp> allowing them to coexist with
distribution installed versions.

   <p>For building documentation, the build host also requires the following
documentation tools:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="command">gs 8.15</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">tetex 3.0</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">texinfo 4.8</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">transfig 3.2.5</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">imagemagick 6.2.4</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">groff 1.17.2</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>Most desktop GNU/Linux distributions will have these tools; however, some
server-style installations (e.g. <cite>Ubuntu</cite>-server) will not and they must
be installed separately.

   <p>For uncooked manual pages, the entire <samp><span class="command">groff</span></samp> package is required on
<cite>Debian</cite> and <cite>Ubuntu</cite> systems (the base package does not include
grefer which is used extensively by uncooked manual pages).  The following will
get what you need:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     Debian: % apt-get install groff_ext
     Ubuntu: % apt-get install groff
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>In addition, the build host requires a complete tool chain for compiling for the
target host, including kernel tools such as <samp><span class="command">genksyms</span></samp> and others.

   <p>If you wish to package rpms on an <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp> system, or debs on a
<samp><span class="command">dpkg</span></samp> system, you will need the appropriate tool chain.  Systems based
on <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp> typically have the necessary toolchain available, however,
<samp><span class="command">dpkg</span></samp> systems do not.  The following on a <cite>Debian</cite> or
<cite>Ubuntu</cite> system will get what you need:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     % apt-get install debhelper
     % apt-get install fakeroot
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>To generate a configuration script and the necessary scriptlets required by the
GNU <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> system, execute the following commands on the working
directory:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     % autoreconf -fiv striso
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">where, <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> is the name of the directory to where the working
copy was checked out under the previous step.  This command generates the
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script and other missing pieces that are normally
distributed with the release Tar Balls, SRPMs and DSCs.

   <p>Make sure that `<samp><span class="samp">autoreconf --version</span></samp>' returns `<samp><span class="samp">2.59</span></samp>'.  Otherwise, you
may need to perform something like the following:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     % PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     % autoreconf -fiv striso
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">After reconfiguring the directory, the package can then be configured and built
using the same instructions as are used for the Tar Ball, see <a href="#Configuring-the-Tar-Ball">Configuring the Tar Ball</a>, and <a href="#Building-from-the-Tar-Ball">Building from the Tar Ball</a>.

   <p>Do note, however, that <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> will rebuild the documentation that is
normally released with the package.  Additional tools may be necessary for
building the documentation.

   <p>When configuring the package in a working directory and while working a
change-compile-test cycle that involves configuration macros or documentation, I
find it of great advantage to invoke the GNU <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> options
<samp><span class="command">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">--enable-dependency-tracking</span></samp>. 
The first of these two options will add maintainer-specific targets to any
generated <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>, and the later will invoke automatic dependency
tracking within the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> so rebuilds after changes to macro, source
or documentation files will be automatically rebuilt.

   <p>When building from the source RPM (see <a href="#Building-from-the-Source-RPM">Building from the Source RPM</a>), it is
possible to pass a number of additional configuration options to the
<samp><span class="command">rpmbuild</span></samp> process.

   <p>The additional configuration options are described below.

   <p>Note that distributions that use older versions of rpm do not have the
`<samp><span class="samp">--with</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--without</span></samp>' options defined.  To acheive the same effect
as:
<pre class="example">     --with someparm=somearg
</pre>
   <p>do:
<pre class="example">     --define "_with_someparm --with-someparm=somearg"
</pre>
   <p>This is a generic description of common <samp><span class="command">rpmbuild</span></samp> options.  Not all
<samp><span class="command">rpmbuild</span></samp> options are applicable to all SRPMs.  Options that are kernel
module specific are only applicable to SRPMs that build kernel modules.  STREAMS
options are only applicable to SRPMs that provide or require STREAMS.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--define "_kversion $PACKAGE_KVERSION"</code><dd><a name="index-PACKAGE_005fKVERSION-67"></a><a name="index-k_002drelease-68"></a>Specifies the kernel version other than the running kernel for which to build. 
If <samp><span class="command">_kversion</span></samp> is not defined when rebuilding, the environment variable
<var>PACKAGE_KVERSION</var> is used.  If the environment variable
<var>PACKAGE_KVERSION</var> is not defined, then the version of the running kernel
(i.e. discovered with `<samp><span class="samp">uname -r</span></samp>') is used as the target version for
kernel-dependent packages.  This option can also be defined in an
<samp><span class="file">.rpmspec</span></samp> file using the macro name `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><code>--with checks</code><dt><code>--without checks</code><dd><a name="index-checks-69"></a>Enable or disable preinstall checks.  Each packages supports a number of
preinstall checks that can be performed by invoking the `<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>' target with
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.  These currently consist of checking each kernel module for
unresolved kernel symbols, checking for documentation for exported kernel module
symbols, checking for documentation for exported library symbols, checking for
standard options for build and installable programs, checking for documentation
for built and installable programs.  Normally these checks are only run in
maintainer mode, but can be enabled and disabled with this option.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-optimize=HOW</code><dt><code>--without k-optimize</code><dd><a name="index-k_002doptimize-70"></a>Specify `<samp><span class="samp">HOW</span></samp>' optimization, <var>normal</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>speed</var> or
<var>quick</var>.  <var>size</var> compiles kernel modules <code>-Os</code>, <var>speed</var>
compiles kernel modules <code>-O3</code>, and <var>quick</var> compiles kernel modules
<code>-O0</code>.  The default is <var>normal</var>.  Use with care.

     <br><dt><code>--with cooked-manpages</code><dt><code>--without cooked-manpages</code><dd><a name="index-cooked_002dmanpages-71"></a>Some systems do not like <samp><span class="command">grefer</span></samp> references in manpages.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-46" name="fnd-46"><sup>46</sup></a>  This option will cook
<samp><span class="command">soelim</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">refer</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">tbl</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">pic</span></samp> commands from
the manpages and also strip <samp><span class="command">groff</span></samp> comments.  The default is to leave
manpages uncooked: they are actually smaller that way.

     <br><dt><code>--with public</code><dt><code>--without public</code><dd><a name="index-public-72"></a>Release public packages or private packages.  This option has no effect on the
<samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> package.  The default is to release public packages.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-debug</code><dt><code>--without k-debug</code><dd><a name="index-k_002ddebug-73"></a>Specifies whether kernel debugging is to be performed on the build kernel
modules.  Mutually exclusive with <code>test</code> and <code>safe</code> below.  This has
the effect of removing static and inline attributes from functions and invoking
all debugging macros in the code.  The default is to not perform kernel
debugging.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-test</code><dt><code>--without k-test</code><dd><a name="index-k_002dtest-74"></a>Specifies whether kernel testing is to be performed.  Mutually exclusive with
<code>debug</code> above and <code>safe</code> below.  This has the effect of removing
static and inline attributes from functions and invoking most debugging macros
in the code.  The default is to not perform kernel testing.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-safe</code><dt><code>--without k-safe</code><dd><a name="index-k_002dsafe-75"></a>Specifies whether kernel saftey is to be performed.  Mutually exclusive with
<code>debug</code> and <code>test</code> above.  This has the effect of invoking some more
pedantic assertion macros in the code.  The default is not to apply kernel
safety.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-inline</code><dt><code>--without k-inline</code><dd><a name="index-k_002dinline-76"></a>Specifies whether kernel <code>inline</code> functions are to be place inline.  This
has the effect of adding the <samp><span class="command">-finline-functions</span></samp> flag to <var>CFLAGS</var>
for compiling kernel modules.  Linux 2.4 kernels are normally compiled
<samp><span class="command">-O2</span></samp> which does not respect the <code>inline</code> directive.  This compiles
kernel modules with <samp><span class="command">-finline-functions</span></samp> to get closer to <samp><span class="command">-O3</span></samp>
optimization.  For better optimization controls, See <a href="#Configuring-the-Tar-Ball">Configuring the Tar Ball</a>.

     <br><dt><code>--with k-modversions</code><dt><code>--without k-modversions</code><dd><a name="index-k_002dmodversions-77"></a>Specifies whether kernel symbol versioning is to be applied to symbols exported
by package kernel modules.  The default is to version exported module symbols. 
This package does not export symbols so this option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>--with devfs</code><dt><code>--without devfs</code><dd>Specifies whether the build is for a device filesystem daemon enabled system
with autoloading, or not.  The default is to build for devfsd autoloading when
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS is defined in the target kernel.  The <samp><span class="command">reuild</span></samp> target
uses this option to signal to the RPM spec file that the `<samp><span class="samp">dev</span></samp>' subpackage
need not be built.  This option does not appear when the package has no devices.

     <br><dt><code>--with devel</code><dt><code>--without devel</code><dd><a name="index-devel-78"></a>Specifies whether to build development environment packages such as those that
include header files, static libraries, manual pages and texinfo
documentation.  The default is to build development environment packages. 
This option can be useful when building for an embedded target where only the
runtime components are desired.

     <br><dt><code>--with tools</code><dt><code>--without tools</code><dd><a name="index-tools-79"></a>Specifies whether user space packages are to be built.  The default is to build
user space packages.  This option can be useful when rebuilding for multiple
architectures and target kernels.  The <samp><span class="command">rebuild</span></samp> automake target uses
this feature when rebuilding for all available architectures and kernels, to
rebuild user packages once per architecture instead of once per kernel.

     <br><dt><code>--with modules</code><dt><code>--without modules</code><dd><a name="index-modules-80"></a>Specifies whether kernel modules packages are to be built.  The default is to
build kernel module packages.  This option can be useful when rebuilding for
multiple architectures and target kernels.  The <samp><span class="command">rebuild</span></samp> automake
target uses this feature to rebuild for all available architectures and kernels.

     <br><dt><code>--with lis</code><dt><code>--without lis</code><dd><a name="index-lis-81"></a>Specifies that the package is to be rebuilt against <cite>Linux STREAMS</cite>.  The
default is to automatically identify whether <samp><span class="file">LiS</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">streams</span></samp> is
loaded on the build system and build accordingly.

     <br><dt><code>--with lfs</code><dt><code>--without lfs</code><dd><a name="index-lfs-82"></a>Specifies that the package is to be rebuilt against <cite>Linux Fast-STREAMS</cite>. 
The default is to automatically identify whether <samp><span class="file">LiS</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">streams</span></samp> is
loaded on the build system and build accordingly.

<p>Additional support is provided for cross-building for the <cite>Performance

CPC-396 cards.  A configuration script wrapper (<samp><span class="file">configure.nexusware</span></samp>) is
provided to simplify the cross-build operation for these targets.  The following
steps describe the process:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Follow the normal <cite>NexusWare</cite> instructions for rebuilding a
<samp><span class="file">generic</span></samp> kernel and flash image as follows:  (Note that I keep my
<cite>NexusWare</cite> build in <samp><span class="file">/u5/NexusWare24</span></samp>.)

     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <pre class="example">          % pushd /u5/NexusWare24
          % source SETUP.sh
          % make
          % popd
     </pre>
     </td></tr></table>

     <p>For more recent <cite>NexusWare</cite> releases, the method for rebuilding a
kernel is a little different as follows:

     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <pre class="example">          % pushd /u5/NexusWare80
          % ./nexus 2.4
          % ./nexus 8260
          % ./nexus quick
          % . SETUP.sh
          % popd
     </pre>
     </td></tr></table>

     <li>Next download, unpack
(see <a href="#Downloading-the-Tar-Ball">Downloading the Tar Ball</a>) and configure (see <a href="#Configuring-the-Tar-Ball">Configuring the Tar Ball</a>) using the provided <samp><span class="file">configure.nexusware</span></samp> wrapper for
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  This wrapper simply tells the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script
where to find the <cite>NexusWare</cite> sources and which <cite>NexusWare</cite>
cross-building tools to use for a cross-compile.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-51" name="fnd-51"><sup>51</sup></a>

     <p>Any of the normal <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script options (see <a href="#Configuring-the-Tar-Ball">Configuring the Tar Ball</a>) can be used on the same line as `<samp><span class="samp">./configure.nexusware</span></samp>'.  One of
particular interest to embedded targets is `<samp><span class="samp">--with-k-optimize=size</span></samp>' to
attempt to reduce the size of the kernel modules.

     <p>You must specify the kernel version of the kernel for which you are configuring. 
Add the &ndash;with-k-release=2.4.18 option for older <cite>NexusWare</cite> releases,
&ndash;with-k-release=2.4.25 or &ndash;with-k-release=2.6.12 for more current
<cite>NexusWare</cite> releases.

     <li>Install as normal (see <a href="#Installing-the-Tar-Ball">Installing the Tar Ball</a>), however, for embedded
targets the <samp><span class="command">install-strip</span></samp> target should be used instead of the
<samp><span class="command">install</span></samp> target.  The <samp><span class="command">install-strip</span></samp> target will strip
unnecessary symbols from kernel modules and further reduce the size in the root
file system flash image.

        </ol>

   <p>Following is what I use for configuration and installation: (My <cite>NexusWare</cite>
tree is rooted at <samp><span class="file">/u5/NexusWare</span></samp>.)

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   </td></tr></table>

   <p>Once built and installed in the <cite>NexusWare</cite> directory, you will have to
(currently) hand edit a <samp><span class="file">.spec</span></samp> file to include the components you want in
the <cite>NexusWare</cite> root file system.  If you are cross-building for
<cite>NexusWare</cite> you should already know what that means.  Objects that you
might be interested in copying to the root file system are kernel modules that
were installed in
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/lib/modules/2.4.18/striso</span></samp>,
libraries installed in <samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp> and utility
functions installed in <samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp> and
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/usr/sbin</span></samp> and test programs in
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/usr/libexec</span></samp>.  If you would prefer that these
programs be installed in <samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/lib</span></samp>,
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>, <samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/sbin</span></samp> and
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/libexec</span></samp>, (say because you want to remote mount
the <samp><span class="file">/usr</span></samp> directory after boot), then specify the `<samp><span class="samp">--exec-prefix=/</span></samp>'
option to `<samp><span class="samp">./configure.nexusware</span></samp>'.

   <p>In addition, because <cite>NexusWare</cite> does not include an
<samp><span class="file">/etc/modules.conf</span></samp> file by default, it will be necessary to add one or
edit your <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp> file to <samp><span class="command">insmod</span></samp> the necessary
<samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> modules at boot time.

   <p>Also, <cite>NexusWare</cite> does not configure its kernels for <var>CONFIG_KMOD</var>,
so any kernel modules must be loaded by the <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp> init script at boot. 
On more recent <cite>NexusWare</cite> releases, the init scripts will be installed
in <samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/etc/rc.d/init.d/</span></samp> but you must manually
edit your <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp> script to invoke these scripts.

   <p>Once you have completed the necessary <samp><span class="file">.spec</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp> file entries,
you need to rebuild the `<samp><span class="samp">generic</span></samp>' kernel flash image once more for these
objects to be included in the flash file system.  It is important that this
second build of the kernel image be the same as the first.

   <p>When modifying and rebuilding a <cite>NexusWare</cite> kernel, it will be necessary to
rebuild and install <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp>.  Simply perform the last `<samp><span class="samp">make
install-strip</span></samp>' stage or start again with `<samp><span class="samp">./configure.nexusware</span></samp>'.  You can
place the unpacked tarball in
<samp><var>$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX</var><span class="file">/usr/src/striso</span></samp>, and add the following to
the top-level <cite>NexusWare</cite> <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> to make the build process a
single step process instead of dual pass:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     all:
     ...
             (cd kernels/generic; $(MAKE) depend)
             (cd usr/src/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1; $(MAKE) config)
             (cd kernels/generic; $(MAKE))
             (cd usr/src/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1; $(MAKE) pti)
             (cd usr/src/pti; $(MAKE))
             (cd drivers; $(MAKE))
             (cd utility; $(MAKE))
     #       uncomment for LiS build
     #       (cd usr/src/LiS; ./configure.nexusware; $(MAKE) install-strip)
     #       uncomment for LfS build
             (cd usr/src/streams; ./configure.nexusware; $(MAKE) install-strip)
     #       uncomment for striso build
     #       (cd usr/src/striso; ./configure.nexusware; $(MAKE) install-strip)
             (cd build/generic; $(MAKE))
     ...
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>Another, perhaps simpler approach, is to make the necessary edits to the
<cite>NexusWare</cite> top-level <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.spec</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp>
files, download and unpack the tar ball into the <cite>NexusWare</cite> directory, and
build the <cite>NexusWare</cite> flash image as normal:

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     % wget http://www.openss7.org/striso-0.9.2.1.rc2.tar.bz2

     % popd
     % make
     % popd

<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
<a name="index-all-198"></a><a name="index-install-199"></a><a name="index-install_002dstrip-200"></a>targets will make the necessary changes to the <samp><span class="file">/etc/modules.conf</span></samp> file and
place the modules in an appropriate place in
<samp><span class="file">/lib/modules/2.6.17-1.2139_FC5/striso</span></samp>. 
The `<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>' process should have copied the kernel module files
<samp><span class="file">streams-*.o</span></samp> to the directory
<samp><span class="file">/lib/modules/2.6.17-1.2139_FC5/striso</span></samp>. 
This means that to load any of these modules, you can simply execute, for
example, `<samp><span class="samp">modprobe stream-</span><var>somedriver</var></samp>'.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-52" name="fnd-52"><sup>52</sup></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.6.1.1 Linux STREAMS Module Loading</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> demand load system supports both the old kerneld and
the new kmod mechanisms for demand loading kernel modules.

   <p>The convention for <samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> kernel loadable object files is:
     <ul>
<li>Their name start with "streams-". 
<li>They are placed in <samp><span class="file">/lib/modules/2.6.17-1.2139_FC5/streams/</span></samp>, where `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is an example kernel version.

   <p>If your kernel has been built using the <samp><span class="file">kerneld</span></samp> daemon, then
<samp><span class="file">striso</span></samp> kernel modules will automatically load as soon as
the STREAMS module is pushed or the driver is opened.  The `<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>'
process makes the necessary changes to the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/modules.conf</span></samp> file.  After the install, you will see
lines like the following added to your <samp><span class="file">/etc/modules.conf</span></samp>

<h4 class="subsection">5.7.1 Makefile Targets</h4>

<p>Automake has many targets, not all of which are obvious to the casual user.  In addition,
<cite>OpenSS7</cite> automake files have additional rules added to make maintaining and releasing a
package somewhat easier.  This list of targets provides some help with what targets can be invoked,
what they do, and what they hope to acheive.  The available targets are as follows:

<p><a name="User-Targets"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.1 User Targets</h5>

<p>The following are normal targets intended to be invoked by installers of the package.  They are
concerned with compiling, checking the compile, installing, checking the installation, and
uninstalling the package.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">[all]</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-all-204"></a>This is also the default target.  It compiles the package.  This is performed after configuring the
source with `<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>'.  A makefile stub is provided so that if the package has not had
autoreconf run (such as when checked out from CVS, the package will attempt to run `<samp><span class="samp">autoreconf
-fiv</span></samp>'.

     <p>All <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> packages are configured without maintainer mode and without dependency
tracking by default.  This speed compilation of the package for one-time builds.  This also means
that if you are developing using the source package (edit-compile-test-cycle), changes made to
source files will not cause the automatic rebuilding due to dependencies.  There are two ways to
enable dependency tracking: specify `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp>' to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>; or,
specify `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-dependency-tracking</span></samp>' to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  I use the former during my
edit-compile-test cycle.

     <p>This is a standard <cite>GNU</cite> <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp> makefile target. 
This target does not require root privilege.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-check-205"></a>All <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> packages provide check scripts for the check target.  This step is
performed after compiling the package and will run all of the check programs against the compiled
binaries.  Which checks are performed depends on whether `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp>' was
specified to configure.  If in maintainer mode, checks that assist with the release of the package
will be run (such as checking that all manual pages load properly and that they have required
sections.)  We recommend running the check stage before installing, because it catches problems that
might keep the installed package from functioning properly.

     <p>Another way to enable the greater set of checks, without invoking maintainer mode, is to specify
`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-checks</span></samp>' to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

     <p>This is a standard <cite>GNU</cite> <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp> makefile target, although the functions performed
are customized for the <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite>. 
This target does not require root privilege.

This target also performs some actions similar to
the pre- and post-install scripts used by packaging tools such as <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">dpkg</span></samp>. 
The `<samp><span class="samp">install-strip</span></samp>' target strips unnecessary symbols from executables and kernel modules
before installing.

     <p>This is a standard <cite>GNU</cite> <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp> makefile target. 
This target requires root privilege.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">installcheck</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-installcheck-208"></a>All <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> packages provide test scripts for the `<samp><span class="samp">installcheck</span></samp>' target.  Test
scripts are created and run using autotest (part of the autoconf package).  Which test suites are
run and how extensive they are depends on whether `<samp><span class="samp">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp>' was specified to
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  When in maintainer mode, all test suites will be run.  When not in maintainer
mode, only a few post-install checks will be performed, but the test suites themselves will be
installed in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/libexec/striso</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-54" name="fnd-54"><sup>54</sup></a> for later use.

     <p>This is a standard <cite>GNU</cite> <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp> makefile target. 
This target might require root privilege.  Tests requiring root privilege will be skipped when run
as a regular user.  Tests requiring regular account privileges will be skipped when run as root.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">retest</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-retest-209"></a>To complement the `<samp><span class="samp">installcheck</span></samp>' target above, all <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> packages provide the
`<samp><span class="samp">retest</span></samp>' target as a means to rerun failed conformance testsuite test cases.  The retest target
is provided because some test cases in the testsuites have delicate timing considerations that allow
them to fail sporadically.  Invoking this target will retest the failed cases until no cases that
are not expected failures remain.

     <p>This is an <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> specific makefile target. 
As with `<samp><span class="samp">installcheck</span></samp>', this target might require root privilege.  Tests requiring root
privilege will be skpped when run as a regular user.  Tests requiring regular account privileges
will be skipped when run as root.

post- erase scripts used by packaging tools such as <cite>rpm</cite> or <cite>dpkg</cite>.  You need to have a

<p><a name="Logging-Targets"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.5 Logging Targets</h5>

<p>For convenience, to log the output of a number of targets to a file, log targets are defined.  The
log file itself is used as the target to make, but make invokes the target minus a <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp>
suffix.  So, for example, to log the results of target `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', invoke the target `<samp><span class="samp">foo.log</span></samp>'. 
The only target that this does not apply to is `<samp><span class="samp">compile.log</span></samp>'.  When you invoke the target
`<samp><span class="samp">compile.log</span></samp>' a simple <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is invoked and logged to the file <samp><span class="file">compile.log</span></samp>. 
The `<samp><span class="samp">foo.log</span></samp>' rule applies to all other targets.  This does not work for all targets, just a
selected few.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-57" name="fnd-57"><sup>57</sup></a> Following are the logging targets:

<h5 class="subsubheading">Common Logging Targets</h5>

   <p>If you want to add one, simply add it to <var>LOGGING_TARGETS</var> in <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>.

<p><a name="Problem-Report-Targets"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.6 Problem Report Targets</h5>

<p>To ease problem report generation, all logging targets will automatically generate a problem report
suitable for mailing in the file <samp><i>target</i><span class="file">.pr</span></samp> for target `<samp><i>target</i><span class="samp">.log</span></samp>'.  This
problem report file is in the form of an email and can be sent using the included <samp><span class="command">send-pr</span></samp>
script or by invoking the `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' makefile target.

   <p>There are two additional problem report targets:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">pr</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-pr-237"></a>The `<samp><span class="samp">pr</span></samp>' target is for independently generating a problem report outside of the build or
installation process.  The target will automatically generate a problem report skeleton suitable for
editting and mailing in the file <samp><span class="file">problem.pr</span></samp>.  This problem report file is in the form of an
email and can be editted and sent directly, or sent using the included <samp><span class="command">send-pr</span></samp> script or
by invoking the `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' target.

     <p>This is an <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> specific makefile target. 
This target does not require root privilege.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-send_002dpr-238"></a>The `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' target is for finalizing and mailing a problem report generated either inside or
outside the build and installation process.  The target will automatically finalize and mail the
<samp><span class="file">problem.pr</span></samp> problem report if it has changed since the last time that `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' was
invoked.

     <p>This is an <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> specific makefile target. 
This target does not require root privilege (unless the problem report file was generated as root). 
</dl>

<p><a name="Release-Archive-Targets"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.7 Release Archive Targets</h5>

<p>The following targets are used to generate and clean distribution archive and signature files. 
Whereas the `<samp><span class="samp">dist</span></samp>' target affects archives in the top build directory, the
`<samp><span class="samp">release-archive</span></samp>' targets affects archives in the package distribution directory (either the
top build directory or that specified with `<samp><span class="samp">--with-pkg-distdir=DIR</span></samp>' to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>).

   <p>You can change the directory to which packages are distributed by using the
`<samp><span class="samp">--with-pkg-distdir=DIR</span></samp>' option to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  The default directory is the top build
directory.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">release-archives</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-release_002darchives-239"></a>This target creates the distribution archive files if they have not already been created.  This not
only runs the `<samp><span class="samp">dist</span></samp>' target, but also copies the files to the distribution directory, which, by
default is the top build directory.

     <p>The files generated are named:

     <p><samp><span class="file">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2.tar.gz</span></samp>
and
<samp><span class="file">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2.tar.bz2</span></samp>

     <p>You can change this distribution directory with the `<samp><span class="samp">--with-pkg-distdir</span></samp>' option to
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  See `<samp><span class="samp">./configure --help</span></samp>' for more details on options.

     <p>This is an <cite>OpenSS7 Project</cite> specific makefile target. 
This target does not require root privilege.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">release-sign-archives</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-release_002dsign_002darchives-240"></a>This target is like `<samp><span class="samp">release-archives</span></samp>', except that it also signs the archives using a
<cite>GPG</cite> detached signature.  You will be prompted for a password unless you pass the
<var>GNUPGPASS</var> variable to make.  For automated or unattended builds, pass the <var>GNUPGPASS</var>
variable like so:

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">make GNUPGPASS=mypasswd release-sign-archives</span></samp>'

     <p>Signature files will be named:

     <p><samp><span class="file">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2.tar.gz.asc</span></samp>
and
<samp><span class="file">striso-0.9.2.1.rc2.tar.bz2.asc</span></samp>

     <p>These files will be moved to the package distribution directory with the plaintext archives.

<p><a name="RPM-Build-Targets"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.8 RPM Build Targets</h5>

<p>On <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp> systems, or systems sporting rpm packaging tools, the following targets are used to
generate <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp> release packages.  The epoch and release number can be controlled by the
contents of the <samp><span class="file">.rpmepoch</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.rpmrelease</span></samp> files, or with the
`<samp><span class="samp">--with-rpm-epoch=EPOCH</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">--with-rpm-release=RELEASE</span></samp>' options to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>. 
See `<samp><span class="samp">configure --help</span></samp>' for more information on options.  We always use release number `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'. 
You can use release numbers above `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">srpm</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-srpm-242"></a>This target generates the source rpm for the package (without signing the source rpm).  The source

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.1 Pre-installation Checks</h4>

<p><a name="index-pre_002dinstallation-checks-254"></a>
Most <cite>OpenSS7</cite> packages, including the <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package, ship with
pre-installation checks integral to the build system.  Pre-installation checks include check scripts
that are shipped in the <samp><span class="file">scripts</span></samp> subdirectory as well as specialized <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> targets
that perform the checks.

   <p>When building and installing the package from <dfn>RPM</dfn> or <dfn>DEB</dfn> source packages
(see <a href="#Building-from-the-Source-RPM">Building from the Source RPM</a>; and <a href="#Building-from-the-Debian-DSC">Building from the Debian DSC</a>), a fundamental set of
post-compile, pre-installation checks are performed prior to building binary packages.  This is
performed automagically and does not require any special actions on the part of the user creating
binary packages from source packages.

   <p>When building and installing the package from <dfn>tarball</dfn> (see <a href="#Building-from-the-Tar-Ball">Building from the Tar Ball</a>; and
<a href="#Installing-the-Tar-Ball">Installing the Tar Ball</a>), however, pre-installation checks are only performed if specifically
invoked by the builder of the package.  Pre-installation checks are invoked after building the
package and before installing the package.  Pre-installation checks are performed by invoking the
`<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">check.log</span></samp>' target to <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> when building the package, as shown
in <a href="#testsuite_003aex0">testsuite:ex0</a>.

<p><dfn>System Checks</dfn> are post-compilation checks that can be performed before installing the package
that check to ensure that the compiled objects function and will be successfully installed.  When
the <samp><span class="option">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp> option has not been passed to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, only
<dfn>System Checks</dfn> will be performed.

   <p>For example, the steps shown in <a href="#testsuite_003aex1">testsuite:ex1</a> will perform <dfn>System</dfn> checks.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.1.2 Pre-Installation Maintenance Checks</h5>

<p><dfn>Maintenance Checks</dfn> include all <dfn>System Checks</dfn>, but also checks to ensure that the kernel
modules, applications programs, header files, development tools, test programs, documentation,
and manual pages conform to <dfn>OpenSS7</dfn> standards.  When the <samp><span class="option">--enable-maintainer-mode</span></samp>
option has been passed to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, <dfn>Maintenance Checks</dfn> will be performed.

   <p>For example, the steps shown in <a href="#testsuite_003aex2">testsuite:ex2</a> will perform <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.1.3 Specific Pre-Installation Checks</h5>

<p>A number of check scripts are provided in the <samp><span class="file">scripts</span></samp> subdirectory of the distribution that
perform both <dfn>System</dfn> and <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.  These are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="command">check_commands</span></samp><dd>
This check performs both <dfn>System</dfn> and <dfn>Maintainance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>System</dfn> tests, the following tests are performed:

     <p>Unless cross-compiling, or unless a program is included in <code>AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT</code>
every program in <code>bin_PROGRAMS</code>, <code>sbin_PROGRAMS</code>, and <code>libexec_PROGRAMS</code> is tested to
ensure that the <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">--copying</span></samp> options are accepted. 
When cross-compiling is is not possible to execute cross-compiled binaries, and these checks are
skpped in that case.

     <p>Script executables, on the other hand, can be executed on the build host, so, unless listed in
<code>AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT</code>, every program in <code>dist_bit_SCRIPTS</code>,
<code>dist_sbin_SCRIPTS</code>, and <code>pkglibexec_SCRIPTS</code> are tested to ensure that the
<samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">--copying</span></samp> options are accepted.

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, <samp><span class="command">check_commands</span></samp> also checks to ensure that a
manual page exists in section 1 for every executable binary or script that will be installed from
<code>bin_PROGRAMS</code> and <code>dist_bin_SCRIPTS</code>.  It also checks to ensure that a manual page exists
in section 8 for every executable binary or script that wil be installed from <code>sbin_PROGRAMS</code>,
<code>dist_sbin_SCRIPTS</code>, <code>libexec_PROGRAMS</code>, and <code>pkglibexec_SCRIPTS</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_decls</span></samp><dd>
This check only performs <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>It collects the results from the <code>check_libs</code>, <code>check_modules</code> and <code>check_headers</code>
check scripts and tests to ensure every declaration of a function prototype or external variable
contained in installed header files has a corresponding exported symbol from either a to be
installed shared object library or a to be installed kernel module.  Declarations are exempted from
this requirement if their identifiers have been explicitly added to the <code>EXPOSED_SYMBOL</code>
variable.  If <code>WARN_EXCESS</code> is set to `<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>', then the check script will only warn when
excess declarations exist (without a corresponding exported symbol); otherwise, the check script
will generate an error and the check will fail.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_headers</span></samp><dd>
This check only performs <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, it identifies all of the declarations included in to be
installed header files.  It then checks to ensure that a manual page exists in sections 2, 3, 7 or
9, as appropriate, for the type of declaration.  It also checks to see if a manual page source file
exists in the source directory for a declaration that has not been included in the distribution. 
Function or prototype declarations that do not have a manual page in sections 2, 3, or 9 will cause
the check to fail.  Other declarations (variable, externvar, macro, enumerate, enum, struct, union,
typedef, member, etc.) will only warn if a manual page does not exist, but will not fail the check.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_libs</span></samp><dd>
This check only performs <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, it checks that each exported symbol in each to be installed
shared object library has a manual page in section 3.  It also checks that each exported symbol has
a function, prototype or externvar declaration in the to be installed header files.  A missing
declaration or manual page will cause this check to fail.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_mans</span></samp><dd>
This check only performs <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, it checks that to be install manual pages can be formatted
for display without any errors or warnings from the build host <samp><span class="command">man</span></samp> program.  It also
checks that required headings exist for manual pages according to the section in which the manual
page will be installed.  It warns if recommended headings are not included in the manual pages. 
Because some <dfn>RPM</dfn> distributions have manual pages that might conflict with the package manual
pages, this check script also checks for conflicts with installed manual pages on the build host. 
This check script also checks to ensure that all to be installed manual pages are used in some
fashion, that is, they have a declaration, or exported symbol, or are the name of a kernel module or
STREAMS module or driver, possibly capitalized.

     <p>Note that checking for conflicts with the build host should probably be included in the <dfn>System</dfn>
checks (because <dfn>System</dfn> checks are performed before the source <dfn>RPM</dfn> <code>%install</code>
scriptlet).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_modules</span></samp><dd>
This check performs both <dfn>System</dfn> and <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>System</dfn> tests, it checks each to be installed kernel module to ensure that all
undefined symbols can be resolved to either the kernel or another module.  It also checks whether an
exported or externally declared symbol conflicts with an exported or externally declared symbol
present in the kernel or another module.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-58" name="fnd-58"><sup>58</sup></a>

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, this check script tests that each to be installed kernel
module has a manual page in section 9 and that each exported symbol that does not begin with an
underscore, and that belongs to an exported function or exported variable, has a manual page in
section 9.  It also checks to ensure that each exported symbol that does not begin with an
underscore, and that blongs to an exported function or exported variable, has a function, prototype
or externvar declaration in the to be installed header files.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">check_streams</span></samp><dd>
This check performs only <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> checks.

     <p>When performing <dfn>Maintenance</dfn> tests, it checks that for each configured <dfn>STREAMS</dfn> module or
driver, or device node, that a manual page exists in section 4 or section 7 as appropriate.

   </dl>

   <p>The output of the pre-installation tests are fairly self explanatory.  Each check script saves some
output to <samp><em>name</em><span class="file">.log</span></samp>, where <em>name</em> is the name of the check script as listed above. 
A summary of the results of the test are display to standard output and can also be captured to the
<samp><span class="file">check.log</span></samp> file if the `<samp><span class="samp">check.log</span></samp>' target is used instead of the `<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>'
target to <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.

   <p>Because the check scripts proliferate <samp><em>name</em><span class="file">.log</span></samp> files throughout the build directory, a
`<samp><span class="samp">make check-clean</span></samp>' <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> target has be provided to clean them out.  `<samp><span class="samp">make
check-clean</span></samp>' should be run before each successive run of `<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>'.

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.2 Post-installation Checks</h4>

<p><a name="index-post_002dinstallation-checks-255"></a>

   <p>Most OpenSS7 packages ship with a combatibility and conformance test suite built using the
`<samp><span class="samp">autotest</span></samp>' capabilities of `<samp><span class="samp">autoconf 2.59</span></samp>'.  These test suites act as a wrapper for the
compatibility and conformance test programs that are shipped with the package.

   <p>Unlike the pre-installation checks, the post-installation checks are always run complete.  The only
check that post-installation test scripts perform is to test whether they have been invoked with
root privileges or not.  When invoked as root, or as a plain user, some tests might be skipped that
require root privileges, or that require plain user privileges, to complete successfully.

<p><a name="Running-Test-Suites"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.2.1 Running Test Suites</h5>

<p><a name="index-test-suites_002c-running-256"></a>
There are several ways of invoking the conformance test suites:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>The test suites can be run after installation of the package by invoking the `<samp><span class="samp">make
installcheck</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">make installcheck.log</span></samp>' target.  Some packages require that root privileges be
acquired before invoking the package.

     <li>The test suites can be run from the distribution subdirectory after installation of the
package by invoking the <samp><span class="command">testsuite</span></samp> shell script directly.

     <li>The test suites can be run standalone from the <samp><span class="file">libexec</span></samp> (<samp><span class="file">/usr/libexec</span></samp>)
installation directory by invoking the <samp><span class="command">testsuite</span></samp> shell script directly.

        </ol>

   <p>Typical steps for invoking the testsuites directly from <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> are shown in
<a href="#testsuite_003aex3">testsuite:ex3</a>.

   <p>When performing post-installation checks for the purposes of generating a problem report, the checks
should always be performed from the build directory, either with `<samp><span class="samp">make installcheck</span></samp>' or by
invoking <samp><span class="command">testsuite</span></samp> directly from the <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> subdirectory of the build directory. 
This ensures that all of the information known to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> and pertinent to the
configuration of the system for which a test case failed, will be collected in the resulting
<samp><span class="file">testsuite.log</span></samp> file depositied upon test suite failure in the <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> directory.  This
<samp><span class="file">testsuite.log</span></samp> file can then be attached as part of the problem report and provides rich
details to maintainers of the package.  See also See <a href="#Problem-Reports">Problem Reports</a>, below.

   <p>Typical steps for invoking and installed <samp><span class="command">testsuite</span></samp> standalone are shown in

<cite>The OpenSS7 Project</cite> uses the <cite>GNU GNATS</cite> system for problem reporting.  Although the
`<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' tool from the <cite>GNU GNATS</cite> package can be used for bug reporting to the project's
<cite>GNATS</cite> database using electronic mail, it is not always convenient to download and install the
<cite>GNATS</cite> system to gain access to the `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' tool.

   <p>Therefore, the <cite>OpenSS7 ISO Stack</cite> package provides the `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' shell script that
can be used for problem reporting.  The `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' shell script can invoked directly and is a
workalike for the <cite>GNU</cite> `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' tool.

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' tool takes the same flags and can be used in the same fashion, however, whereas
`<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' is an interactive tool<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-59" name="fnd-59"><sup>59</sup></a>, `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' is also able to perform batch
processing.  Whereas `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' takes its field information from local databases or from using
the `<samp><span class="samp">query-pr</span></samp>' C-language program to query a remote database, the `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' tool has the
field database internal to the tool.

   <p>Problem reports can be generate using <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, See <a href="#Problem-Report-Targets">Problem Report Targets</a>.  An example of
how simple it is to generate a problem report is illustrated in <a href="#autopr_003aex0">autopr:ex0</a>.

<div align="center">Version 2, June 1991</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">A.1.1 Preamble</h4>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<div align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </ol>

     <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

     <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any
later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     <div align="center"><b>NO WARRANTY</b></div>

     <li><b>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</b>

     <li><b>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</b>
        </ol>

<div align="center"><b>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></div>

<h4 class="subsection">A.1.2 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var> <var>name of author</var>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands `<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>' should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items&mdash;whatever
suits your program.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     <var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>
   <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">B.1.1 Preamble</h4>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software&mdash;typically libraries&mdash;of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   <p>We call this license the <dfn>Lesser</dfn> General Public License because it
does <em>Less</em> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

   <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

<div align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called &ldquo;this License&rdquo;).  Each
licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>A &ldquo;library&rdquo; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     <p>The &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &ldquo;work based on the
Library&rdquo; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)

     <p>&ldquo;Source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.

          <li>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

     <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

     <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     <p>However, linking a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &ldquo;work that uses the
library&rdquo;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     <p>When a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

     <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

     <li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

     <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &ldquo;work that
uses the Library&rdquo;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

          <li>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

          <li>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

          <li>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

          <li>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
          </ol>

     <p>For an executable, the required form of the &ldquo;work that uses the
Library&rdquo; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

     <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

     <li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

          <li>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          </ol>

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

     <div align="center"><b>NO WARRANTY</b></div>

     <li><b>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</b>

     <li><b>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.</b>
        </ol>

<div align="center"><b>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></div>

<h4 class="subsection">B.1.2 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h4>

<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

   <p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
     USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">C.1.1 Preamble</h4>

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

   <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

   <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

<div align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<acronym>PDF</acronym>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> for which
the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>In any section entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section as &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo;,
and any sections entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections
entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo;, and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<div align="center"><b>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></div>

<h4 class="subsection">C.1.2 How to use this License for your documents</h4>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write &ldquo;with no Invariant Sections&rdquo;
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write &ldquo;no Front-Cover Texts&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>&rdquo;; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install the groff extension package
(`<samp><span class="samp">groff_ext</span></samp>'), as it contains the <samp><span class="command">refer</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">grefer</span></samp> commands necessary for
including references in the manual pages.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> Although this an other OpenSS7 STREAMS packages will build and install with Linux STREAMS
(LiS), <b>Linux STREAMS (LiS) is deprecated and cannot be supported because it is full of bugs!</b></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> Items marked as `<samp><span class="samp">TBD</span></samp>' are scheduled to have support deprecated.  That
is, in a future release, the distributions marked `<samp><span class="samp">TBD</span></samp>' will not longer be validated before
release.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> At a later date, it
is possible to move this package into the kernel, however, with continued resistance to STREAMS from
within the <dfn>Linux</dfn> developer community, this is currently unlikely.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> <cite>Linux STREAMS</cite> is buggy, unsupported and deprecated.  Do not use it.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> See section <b>NO WARRANTY</b> under <a href="#GNU-General-Public-License">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-17" href="#fnd-17">17</a>]</small> Not
all distributions support the `<samp><span class="samp">%dev</span></samp>' RPM macro: a case in point is the SuSE
8.0 distribution which uses an older version of <samp><span class="command">rpm</span></samp>.  Distributions
that do not support the `<samp><span class="samp">%dev</span></samp>' macro will build devices as a `<samp><span class="samp">%post</span></samp>'
operation.  Note also that not all release packages contain devices.  Only
packages that provide STREAMS character device drivers need devices, and then
only when the `<samp><span class="samp">specfs</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">devfsd</span></samp>' is not being used.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-18" href="#fnd-18">18</a>]</small> Note that not all releases have source RPM packages.  Release packages
that do not contain kernel modules do not generate a source RPM package.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-19" href="#fnd-19">19</a>]</small> Note that not all release packages contain shared libraries, and,
therefore, not all release packages contain this package.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-20" href="#fnd-20">20</a>]</small> Note that on <cite>Mandrakelinux</cite>, unlike other RPM
kernel distributions, kernel packages for the ix86 architectures are always
placed in i586 architecture packages regardless of the true processor
architecture of the kernel package.  <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> detects this and builds
the appropriate packages.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-21" href="#fnd-21">21</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of
`<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.  Note also that only release
packages that contain kernel modules will contain a <samp><span class="file">core</span></samp> subpackage.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-22" href="#fnd-22">22</a>]</small> Note that only release packages
that contain kernel modules and that export versioned symbols will contain a
<samp><span class="file">info</span></samp> subpackage.  Also, this subpackage is only applicable to 2.4 series
kernels and is not necessary and not built for 2.6 series kernels.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-23" href="#fnd-23">23</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of
`<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-24" href="#fnd-24">24</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of
`<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-25" href="#fnd-25">25</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>'
of `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-26" href="#fnd-26">26</a>]</small> Note that only release
packages that contain kernel modules and that export versioned symbols will

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-27" href="#fnd-27">27</a>]</small> Note that the
`<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-28" href="#fnd-28">28</a>]</small> Note that only release
packages that contain kernel modules and that export versioned symbols will
contain a <samp><span class="file">streams-info</span></samp> subpackage.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-29" href="#fnd-29">29</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of
`<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-30" href="#fnd-30">30</a>]</small> Note that not all release packages contain devices.  Only packages
that provide STREAMS character device drivers need devices, and then only when
the `<samp><span class="samp">specfs</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">devfsd</span></samp>' is not being used.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-31" href="#fnd-31">31</a>]</small> Note that not all releases have source DEB packages.  Release packages
that do not contain kernel modules do not generate a source DEB package.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-32" href="#fnd-32">32</a>]</small> Note that not all release packages contain shared libraries, and,
therefore, not all release packages contain this package.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-33" href="#fnd-33">33</a>]</small> Note that on <cite>Mandrakelinux</cite>, unlike other DEB
kernel distributions, kernel packages for the ix86 architectures are always
placed in i586 architecture packages regardless of the true processor
architecture of the kernel package.  <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> detects this and builds
the appropriate packages.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-34" href="#fnd-34">34</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of
`<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.  Note also that only release
packages that contain kernel modules will contain a <samp><span class="file">core</span></samp> subpackage.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-35" href="#fnd-35">35</a>]</small> Note that only release packages
that contain kernel modules and that export versioned symbols will contain a
<samp><span class="file">info</span></samp> subpackage.  Also, this subpackage is only applicable to 2.4 series
kernels and is not necessary and not built for 2.6 series kernels.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-36" href="#fnd-36">36</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-43" href="#fnd-43">43</a>]</small> A notable exception is
Debian.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-44" href="#fnd-44">44</a>]</small> Note that the
`<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-45" href="#fnd-45">45</a>]</small> Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>'
of `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.  Also, note that the `<samp><span class="samp">info</span></samp>'
subpackage is only applicable to the 2.4 kernel series.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-46" href="#fnd-46">46</a>]</small> In
particular, some <cite>Debian</cite> systems do not load the <samp><span class="command">groff</span></samp>
extensions package and do not have <samp><span class="command">grefer</span></samp> installed.  Although this is
an oversight on the configuration of the particular <cite>Debian</cite> system, we
accomodate such misconfiguration with this feature.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-47" href="#fnd-47">47</a>]</small> In particular, some <cite>Debian</cite> systems do not load the

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-50" href="#fnd-50">50</a>]</small> Because it <em>is</em> a
cross-build, the kernel version on the build machine is unlikely to be the
kernel version of the target machine, except by coincidence.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-51" href="#fnd-51">51</a>]</small> Although I have not
tried it, because we use GNU <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> for configuration, these
instructions should work equally well for the Solaris <cite>NexusWare</cite>
cross-building environment as it does for the Linux <cite>NexusWare</cite>
cross-building environment.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-52" href="#fnd-52">52</a>]</small> Note that the
`<samp><span class="samp">_kversion</span></samp>' of `<samp><span class="samp">2.6.17-1.2139_FC5</span></samp>' is only an example.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-53" href="#fnd-53">53</a>]</small> At some time I expect to create an
`<samp><span class="samp">install-nexusware</span></samp>' target that will make the necessary modifications to
the <samp><span class="file">.spec</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">rc.4</span></samp> files automatically.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-54" href="#fnd-54">54</a>]</small> <samp><span class="file">/usr/libexec/striso</span></samp> is
just an example, the actual location is <samp><span class="file">${libexecdir}/${PACKAGE}</span></samp>, which varies from
distribution to distribution (as some distributions such as Mandriva do not have a libexec
directory).</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-55" href="#fnd-55">55</a>]</small> Therefore, it is possible to download
the package, configure it, and then uninstall it.  This is handy if you do not have the sources used
to build and install the package immediately available.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-56" href="#fnd-56">56</a>]</small> This is useful from the <cite>OpenSS7 Master Package</cite>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-57" href="#fnd-57">57</a>]</small> Note that because logging targets invoke a pipe, <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> does not
return the correct return status (always returns success if the <samp><span class="command">tee</span></samp> operation is
successful).  Therefore, these targets should not be invoked by scripts that need to use the return
value from <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-58" href="#fnd-58">58</a>]</small> This particular check has caught some namespace
polution that has occurred in the 2.6.11 kernel.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-59" href="#fnd-59">59</a>]</small> `<samp><span class="samp">send-pr</span></samp>' launches the user's <var>EDITOR</var> to
