.HP
.BI "lis_splx(pl_t " pl ");"
.HP
.BI "void lis_splx_fcn(pl_t " pl ", char *" file ", int " line ");
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I pl
the priority level to set.
.TP
.I file
The file where the function was called, typically
.BR __FILE__ .
.TP
.I line
The line number in the file, typically
.BR __LINE__ .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR splx ()
restores a previous priority level and returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The following code snippet illustrates the use of the
.BR splx ()
function:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
{
	pl_t save_pl = splstr();

	/* do some stuff */

	splx(save_pl);
}
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When the
.BR splx ()
function succeeds, it restores the specified priority level and returns
.BR void ;
when it fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR splx ()
fiales when the specified
.I pl
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
The
.BR splx ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
The
.BR splx ()
function is MP-safe; however, it does not perform well in an MP environment and
is almost always not what the author intended.  It is wiser to use basic or
read-write locks for mutual exclusion, rather than relying on suppression of
local bottom half or hard interrupts for serialization.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I LiS
implementation of
.BR splx ()
simply restores flags from the
.I pl
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.PP
.BR splx ()
and family are
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
functions.
.PP
There is, in fact, only one
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.I STREAMS
driver that uses this function, and that is the
.BR ldl (4)
driver.  Also, the
.BR ldl (4)
driver misused this function, and has been converted to no longer use it.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR SPL0 (9),
.BR SPLSTR (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR splx ()
does not follow
.I SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
rules for arguments of type
.BR pl_t .
In particular, it does not follow the ordinality rules for arguments of this
type.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR splx ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR splx ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR splx ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR splx ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
