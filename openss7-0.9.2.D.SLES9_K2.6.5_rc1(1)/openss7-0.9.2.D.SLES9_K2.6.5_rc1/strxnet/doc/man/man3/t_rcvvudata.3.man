.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to receive scatter-gather data.
.TP
.I data
a pointer to a
.B t_unitdata
structure to contain the returned address and options information.
.TP
.I iov
a pointer to a
.B t_iovec
structure containing a scatter-gather array into which to receive the data.
.TP
.I iovcnt
a count of the number of buffer vectors in the array.
.TP
.I flags
a pointer to an
.I int
to contain the received data flags.
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_recvvudata ()
receives a unitdata indication and places the recieved data into scatter
buffers.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which the unitdata indication
arrives.
.PP
.I data
is a
.B t_unitdata
structure that returns the unitdata message information.
.PP
.I iov
is a pointer to an array of
.B t_iovec
structures specifying the scatter buffers.
.PP
.I iovcnt
is the count of the number of
.B t_iovec
structures in the array pointed to by
.IR iov .
.PP
.I flags
are flags returned describing the received data.  Flags returned by
.BR t_rcvvudata ()
can be a btiwise OR of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
indicates on return that a subsequent receive operation is necesary to receive
the remainder of the data belonging to the same transport service data unit.
.PP
The
.B t_iovec
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_iovec {
        void *iov_base;
        size_t iov_len;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_iovec
structure specifies the following members:
.TP
.I iov_base
The base of the buffer.
.TP
.I iov_len
The length of the buffer.
.PP
When data is recieved, each buffer in the array of buffers
.I iov
are used in order until they are filled and then data is filled into the next
sequential buffer in the array.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvvudata ()
is only valid in the
.BR T_IDLE
state.
.PP
.BR t_rcvvudata ()
is only valid for service transport providers of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvvudata ()
blocks until a unitdata indication is available.  In asynchronous mode when
there is not unitdata indication immediately available,
.BR t_rcvvudata ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TNODATA ].
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvudata ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvudata ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available opaque information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
