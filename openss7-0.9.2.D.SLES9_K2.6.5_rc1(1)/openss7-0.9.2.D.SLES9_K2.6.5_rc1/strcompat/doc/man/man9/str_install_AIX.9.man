.TP
.I sc_name
Specifies the name of the driver or module.  For modules, this name is
installed in the
.B fmodsw
table and is used for
.BR I_PUSH
operations (see
.BR streamio (7)).
For drivers, this name is used only for reporting with the
.BR scls (8)
and
.BR strinfo (8)
commands.
.TP
.I sc_str
A pointer to the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.
.TP
.I sc_open_stylesc_flags
Gosh does that ever look like a typo!
Specifies the style of the driver or module open routine and characteristics
of the module or driver.  Possible values are:
.RS
.PP
One of the following two flags must be set to indicate the style of
the module's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure:
.TP
.B STR_NEW_OPEN
The
.BR qopen (9)
syntax and semantics as used in
.IR "SVR 4" .
.[
svr4
.]
.TP
.B STR_OLD_OPEN
The
.BR qopen (9)
syntax and semantics as used in
.IR "SVR 3"
.[
svr3
.]
.PP
If the module is multiprocessor-safe, the following flag should be added by
using the bitwise OR operator:
.TP
.B STR_MPSAFE
The driver or module was designed to be run on an MP system.
.PP
If the module uses callback functions that need to be protected against
interrupts (non-interrupt-safe callback functions) for the
.BR timeout (9)
or
.BR bufcall (9)
callbacks, the following flag should be added by using the bitwise OR
operator:
.TP
.B STR_QSAFETY
Specifies that the driver or module uses non-interrupt-safe callback functions
for the
.BR timeout (9)
or
.BR bufcall (9)
callbacks.
(See also
.BR itimeout (9).)
This flag is automatically set by
.I STREAMS
if the module is not multiprocesor-safe.
.TP
.B STR_PERSTREAM
Specifies that the module accepts to run at per-stream synchronization level.
.TP
.B STR_Q_NOTTOSPEC
Specifies that the module is designed to run it's service procedure
.RB ( srvp (9))
under process context.
By default
.I STREAMS
.BR srvp (9)
procedure run at interrupt context (softIRQ).  If the
.I STREAMS
module wants to execute its
.BR srvp (9)
procedure under process context, it needs to set this flag.
.TP
.B STR_64BIT
Specifies that the module is capable of supporting 64-bit data types.
.TP
.B STR_NEWCLONING
Specifies that the driver open uses new-style cloning.  Under this style, the
driver
.BR qopen (9)
does not check for
.B CLONEOPEN
and yet returns a new device number.
.RE
.TP
.I sc_major
Specifies the major number of the device.
.TP
.I sc_sqlevel
Specifies the synchronization level to be used by
.I STREAMS
for the module.  There are seven levels of synchronization as follows:
.RS
.TP
.BR SQLVL_NOP "\- No synchronization"
Specifies that each queue can be accessed by more than one thread at the same
time.  The protection of internal data and of
.BR putp (9)
and
.BR srvp (9)
procedure against
.BR timeout (9)
or
.BR bufcall (9)
is done by the module or driver itself.  This synchronization level should be
used essentially for multiprocessor-efficient modules.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_QUEUE "\- Queue level"
Specifies that each queue can be accessed by only one thread at the same time.
This is the finest synchronization level, and should only be used when the two
sides of a queue pair do not share common data.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR "\- Queue pair level"
Specifies that each queue pair can be accessed by only one thread at the same
time.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_MODULE "\- Module level"
Specifies that all instances of a module can be accessed by only one thread at
the same time.  This is the default value.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_ELSEWHERE "\- Arbitrary level"
Specifies that a group of modules can be accessed by only one thread at the
same time.  Usually, the group of modules is a set of cooperating modules, such
as a protocol family.  The group is defined by using the same name in the
.I sc_sqinfo
field for each module in the group.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_GLOBAL "\- Global level"
Specifies that all of
.I STREAMS
can be accessed by only one thread at the same time.  This option should
normally be used only for debugging.
.TP
.BR SQLVL_DEFAULT "\- Default level"
Specifies the default level, set to
.BR SQLVL_MODULE .
.RE
.TP
.I sc_sqinfo
Specifies an optional group name.  This field is only used when the
.BR SQLVL_ELSEWHERE
arbitrary synchronization level is set; all modules having the same name belong
to one group.  The name size is limited to eight
.RB ( FMNAMESZ )
characters.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
When

.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The module is in use and cannot be unloaded.
.TP

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR str_install ()
is a
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _AIX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE
defined.

.PP
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR str_install ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR str_install ()
is compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Under
.IR AIX \(rg
to support dynamic loading and unloading of kernel modules, each
.I STREAMS
module or driver provides a configuration procedure.  This procedure is called
each time the extension is referenced in a load or unload operation.  The
system provides a name and a device number when the module loads.
.IP ""
Under
.B Linux
it is necessary to hook into the
.BR module_init (9)
and
.BR module_term (9)
procedures and assign the
.I name
and
.I dev
number using
.BR MOD_PARM (9).
By convention, these module options are called
.I name
and
.IR major .
.IP ""
A driver's
.BR module_init (9)
routine should assign
.I name
and
.I major
to the
.B strconf_t
structure and call
.BR str_install ()
with
.BR STR_LOAD_DEV ;
the
.BR module_term (9)
routine should call
.BR str_install ()
with
.BR STR_UNLOAD_DEV .
.IP ""
A module's
.BR module_init (9)
routine should call
.BR str_install ()
with
.BR STR_LOAD_MOD ;
the
.BR module_term (9)
routine should call
.BR str_install ()
with
.BR STR_UNLOAD_MOD .
.IP \(em
Use of
.BR str_install ()
requires different include file sequences on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
than on
.IR AIX \(rg.
.IR AIX \(rg
includes
.B <pse/mi.h>
and
.B <sys/stream.h>
only.
.IP \(em
On
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
synchronization flags are not supported.  On
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
synchronization flags are fully supported.
.IP \(em
.BR str_install ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR AIX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR AIX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR AIX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR str_install ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR AIX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR str_install ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
