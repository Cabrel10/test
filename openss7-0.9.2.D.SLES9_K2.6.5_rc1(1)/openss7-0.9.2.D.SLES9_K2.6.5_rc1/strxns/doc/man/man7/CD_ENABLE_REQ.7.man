.SH NAME
.B CD_ENABLE_REQ
\- prepare a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_dial_type;
    cd_ulong cd_dial_length;
    cd_ulong cd_dial_offset;
} cd_enable_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the communications device be
prepared for service and enabled.
.PP
A CDI stream that is in the
.B CD_DISABLED
state is not yet ready for transmission.  Before the stream can be used for
transmission, it must be successfully enabled with the
.B CD_ENABLE_REQ
primitive.
Successful processing of the
.B CD_ENABLE_REQ
primitive moves the stream to the
.B CD_ENABLED
state.
.PP
If the communications device returns the
.B CD_CANDIAL
flag in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7),
the device is capable of dialing and a dial string can be provided,
specified by the
.I cd_dial_length
and
.I cd_dial_offset
fields.
The specification of the dial string is provider- and device-specific.
.PP
In the
.B CD_ENABLED
state, the stream is able to transmit but have not yet necessarily been
allowed for input.
If the stream returns
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7),
the communications device will be allowed for both transmission and reception
upon successful completion of the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ ;
however, if the
.B CD_AUTOALOW
flag is not returned, the CD user must first call
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ (7)
before reception can begin.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_dial_type
Specifies the type of the provided dial string.  The type can be set to a
provider- or device-specific type, or can be set as follows:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_NODIAL
Specifies that there is no dial string associated with the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ .
.RE
.TP
.I cd_dial_length
Specifies the length of the dial string.
Specification of dial strings is only allowed when the provider returns
.B CD_CANDIAL
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.CD CD_INFO_ACK (7).
When no dial string is specified by
the user,
or
.I cd_dial_type
is set to
.BR CD_NODIAL ,
this field is set to zero (0).
.TP
.I cd_dial_offset
Specifies the offset of the dial string from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
When
.I cd_dial_length
is zero (0), this field is ignored.
.SS State
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CD_DISABLED .
The new state is
.B CD_ENABLED
for streams that do not return
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7),
or the new state is
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
for those streams that do return
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7).
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires that the provider acknowledge the receipt of the
primitive as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
Upon success, the provider confirms that the device is enabled with the
.BR CD_ENABLE_CON (7)
primitive.
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
Upon failure, the provider acknowledges the receipt of the primitive with the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive indicating the error.
.SH ERRORS
