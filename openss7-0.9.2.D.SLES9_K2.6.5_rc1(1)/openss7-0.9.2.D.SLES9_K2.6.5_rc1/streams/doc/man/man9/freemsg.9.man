.BI "void freemsg(mblk_t *" mp ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
the message to free.

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
frees the
.IR STREAMS (4)
message pointed to by
.I mp
and the associated message blocks, data blocks and data buffers.
.PP
Freeing the message blocks of the message might or might not result in the
deallocation of the message blocks, data blocks or data buffers, depending
upon the internal implementation, the binding of message blocks to data blocks
and whether the buffers are internal or external buffers.
.PP
For external data buffers that are to be freed, the
.I function
will be called with the
.I arg
provided previously to a
.BR esballoc (9)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If the block pointer,
.IR bp ,
passed to
.BR freeb ()
is
.BR NULL ,
then
.BR freeb ()
will silently fail.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
is MP-safe.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that it has the last
remaining reference to the message blocks in the passed in message.
.\"
.\"
.\".SH NOTICES

.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
is implemented with a looping call to
.BR freeb (9),
following along the
.I b_cont
pointer of each message block in the message block chain beginning with the passed in message block,
.IR mp .
.PP
See
.BR freeb (9)
for more information.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR freemsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I "SVR 4"
.[

.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
See
.BR freeb (9)
for additional compatibility information.
.IP \(em
In addition,
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
uses a free list to hold freed message blocks and data blocks.  It is
particularly inefficient for cache performance to do this.
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
should use kernel memory caches instead and should free the message blocks and
data blocks when they are no longer used to allow existing cache slots to be
reused.  Bypassing the kernel memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms
by using a free list results in poorer performance than might be expected by
those that do not understand kernel memory caching mechanisms.
