.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/npi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/npi_ip.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B NPI-IP
provides a Stream supporting the Network Provider Interface,
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
to the Internet Protocol,
.BR ip (7).
This
.IR STREAMS (4)
interface provides the
.BR ip (7)
protocol service interface using the N-primitives of the
.BR npi (7).
This interface is intended solely for use by user programs or protocol modules
requiring the common
.BR npi (7)
interface, such as the
.BR xti (3)
and
.BR sockets (3)
library.
.\"
.SS "Address Formats"
.PP
For consistency with other protocol modules, the address format used by
.B NPI-IP
is a Internet Protocol socket address
.RB ( sockaddr_in
structure)
in address family
.B AF_INET
or
.RB ( sockaddr_in6
structure)
in address family
.BR AF_INET6 .
The
.B sockaddr_in
structure is described in
.BR ip (7).
The
.B sockaddr_in6
structure is described in
.BR ipv6 (7).
.PP
.B NPI-IP
supports the notion of multi-homing in support of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
.[
rfc2960
.]
described in
.BR sctp (4).
SCTP requires that an association be bound to multiple IP or IPv6 addresses.
In support of multi-homing,
.B NPI-IP
permits multiple addresses to be specified to bind.  When multiple addresses
are required, they are specified as a special packed list of
.BR sockaddr_in  " or " sockaddr_in6
structures.  The list forms the address specified using the
.IR ADDR_length " and " ADDR_offset
fields in the
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7),
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
and
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7)
primitives.
.PP
For IPv4, the format of the address is a
.BR sockaddr_in
structure followed by an array of
.I sin_addr
members.  This is a
.B sockaddr_ina
structure defined as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sockaddr_ina {
    unsigned short sin_family;
    unsigned short sin_port;
    struct in_addr sin_addr[];

There are a number of purposes for this NPI-IP driver:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
has a need for a solution for providing a pseudo-device driver for RTP (Real-Time Transport
Protocol),
.[
rfc1889
.]
.BR rtp (4).
Because RTP runs over UDP (User Datagram Protocol), it is necessary to intercept packets ahead of
Linux' native UDP at the IP level to avoid the inefficiencies of opening Sockets from inside the
kernel.  This NPI-IP driver accomplishes that feat.  It also permits a single Stream to be opened
but which communicates on many RTP channels.
.IP 2.
The
.I OpenSS7 Project
has a need for a direct interface and interception (drop and insert) capabilities at the IP level
for the purposes of testing both RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol),
.[
rfc1889
.]
.BR rtp (4),
and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol),
.[
rfc2960
.]
.BR sctp (4).
This need is less critical because of the availability of Ferry-Clip testing, using STREAMS-based
pipes, that can be rigged to RTP and SCTP to achieve the same effect.
.IP 3.
Although historically the STREAMS SCTP driver hooks directly to the Linux native IP subsystem at the
driver-kernel level, it might be of some advantage to make SCTP a pushable module that simply pushes
over one of these NPI-IP Streams, or a multiplexing driver under which one of these NPI-IP Streams
is permanently linked at system initialization.  The ability to bind multiple addresses is of use to
SCTP.
.IP 4.
Although there is no prevailing standardized way of interfacing to the IP layer of various
.IR UNIX \(rg
operating systems, such as
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc
.]
it might be possible to make the
.I OpenSS7 Project
RTP and SCTP drivers immediately portable to other operating systems with STREAMS such as
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR pSOS \(rg,
.IR vxWorks \(rg,
.IR LynxOS \(rg,
etc. by simply porting the NPI-IP driver instead of each protocol driver.

There is, in fact, no standard for using the Network Provider Interface (NPI)

various releases of the

This Corrigendum conforms where possible to the
