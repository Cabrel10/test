.SH NAME
.B M_PCCTL
\- \fISTREAMS\fP priority control message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_PCCTL
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_PCCTL
message is a high priority message that consists of one
.B M_PCCTL
message block followed by zero or more
message blocks of unspecified type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_PCCTL
message is generated by modules that wish to send information to a particular module or type of module.
.B M_PCCTL
messages are typically used for inter-module communication, as when adjacent
.I STREAMS
protocol modules negotiate the terms of their interface.  An
.B M_PCCTL
message cannot be generated directly by a user-level process and is always discarded if passed to
the
Stream head.
.PP
.B M_PCCTL
is a high priority message that is not subject to flow control within a
Stream.
Intermediate modules are expected to pass the
.B M_PCCTL
message without queueing it.
.\"
.B M_PCCTL
messages cannot be generated by a user level process.
.B M_PCCTL
message arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_PCCTL
messages can be generated by drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Guidelines for processing the
.B M_PCCTL
message are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not recognize an
.B M_PCCTL
message must pass the message along in the same manner as any high priority messages.  That
is, they are not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
A driver that does not recognize an
.B M_PCCTL
message, discards the message.
.IP \(bu
A driver or module processing an
.B M_PCCTL
message does so with regard to the definitions agreed upon between modules.
.PP
Although
.B M_PCCTL
messages are unstructured and can be used for inter-module communication in a manner defined by the
modules involved, the intended use of
.B M_PCCTL
messages is to provide an inter-module communication mechanism similar to that provided by the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message when communicating with a user level process.
This is also the approach used for the normal priority
.BR M_CTL (9)
message.  The difference between the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message and the
.B M_PCCTL
message is that the
.B M_PCCTL
is a high priority message, whereas the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message is a normal priority message.
Other than being a high priority message, with the ramifications that implies, the use
and procedures for the
.B M_PCCTL
message is the same as the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B M_PCCTL
message is documented only by
.IR UnixWare \(rg.
.[
uw7spg
.]
It is provided to assist porting of drivers and modules written for
.IR UnixWare \(rg
to
.BR Linux .
It might be necessary to define
.B _UW7_SOURCE
before including
.RB < sys/stream.h >
to expose this symbol.
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_PCCTL
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[

.]
documents the
.BR M_PCCTL ,
.BR M_PCSETOPTS (9)
and
.BR M_TRAIL (9)
message types.
These message and message block types are provided for source compatibility with drivers
written for
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7spg
.]
and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
It might be necessary to define
.B _UW7_SOURCE
before including
.RB < sys/stream.h >
to expose these symbols.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.BR M_PCCTL ,
.BR M_PCSETOPTS (9)
or
.BR M_TRAIL (9)
message types.
.IP \(em
.B M_PCCTL
is supported for compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg.
.[

Any use not described in this manual page is explicitly unsupported.
.IP ""
Portable

drivers and modules will not use the
.BR M_PCCTL
message, and will treat the message as a high priority message of unknown type.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
