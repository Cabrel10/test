.SH INTERFACE

.IR "STREAMS Administrative Driver" :
.I User
and
.IR DDI/DKI .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strapush
structure is a structure defined in
.RB < sys/sad.h >
that is used by the
.IR "STREAMS Adminstrative Driver" ,
see
.BR sad (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B strapush
structure is used by a user level process that opens the
.BR sad (4)
driver and is the argument of a numer of input-output controls,
.IR ioctl (2s),
that are supported by the driver.
See
.BR sad (4)
for details.
.PP
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
also uses the
.B strapush
structure within the
.I STREAMS
subsystem in the kernel for maintaining and controlling
.BR autopush (8)
lists.
See
.BR apush_set (9),
.BR apush_get (9),
.BR apush_vml (9),
for details.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I sap_anchor
member was added for
.IR Solaris \(rg
support.
The
.I sap_module
member was added to support use of a driver name instead of a major device number.
Both are
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
implementation specific members.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B strapush
structure is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B strapush
includes the additional member,
.IR sap_anchor ,
in support of the
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc
.]
anchor mechanism.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
applications, modules and drivers will not access the
.I sap_anchor
member.
.IP \(em
.B strapush
includes the additional member,
.IR sap_module ,
that permits drivers to be referenced by name instead of only by major device number.  Although this
is a common extension provided by a number of implementations of the
.BR sad (4)
driver, it is non-portable.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
applications will not access the
.I sap_module
member.
.IP \(em
.B strapush
declares all members directly.  Some implementations, notably
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc
.]
implements this structure as a collection of unions and defines the members as using C pre-processor
macros.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
applications will not depend on any given member of the structure being directly declared or
declared as a C pre-processor macro.
.IP \(em
Because there are fundamental differences between
.IR "SVR 4.2"
and
.B Linux
data types, binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.IR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
