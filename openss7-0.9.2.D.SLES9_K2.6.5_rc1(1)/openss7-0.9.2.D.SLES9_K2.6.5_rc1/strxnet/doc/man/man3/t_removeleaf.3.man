.TH T_REMOVELEAF 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B t_removeleaf
\- remove a point from a point to multipoint connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_removeleaf(int " fd ", int " leafid ", int " reason );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint from which a leaf is to be removed.
.TP
.I leafid
the leaf identifier to remove.
.TP
.I reason
the reason for removing the leaf.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Requests that an endpoint be removed from a point to multipoint connection.
.PP
.I fd
is the filed descriptor of the local transport endpoint.
.PP
.I leafid
is a transport user assigned integer value which was used to identify the
point added to the point to multipoint connection when
.BR t_addleaf (3)
was called.  This is the point to remove from the point to multipoint
connection.
.PP
.I reason
is the reason for disconnecting the endpoint from the point to multipoint
connection.
.I reason
values are transport service provider specific.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_removeleaf ()
is only valid in the
.B T_DATAXFER
state.
.PP
.BR t_removeleaf ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD
that support point to multipoint connection management.
.\".PP
.\"In synchronous mode,
.\".BR t_removeleaf ()
.\"blocks until a leaf change confirmation is received.
.\"In asynchronous mode where no leaf change confirmation is immediately
.\"avaialble,
.\".BR t_removeleaf ()
.\"fails, returns -1 and sets
.\".IR t_errno (3)
.\"to
.\".BR TNODATA .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_removeleaf ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_removeleaf ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_removeleaf ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.BR errno (3).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.

.BR t_addleaf (3),
.BR t_errno (3),
.BR t_look (3).

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
.BR t_removeleaf ()
has no known bugs.
.BR t_removeleaf ()
has been tested for the described behavior using the
.BR test-xnet (8)
and
.BR test-xnet_thr (8)
conformance test suites.
