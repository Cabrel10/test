.TP
.I sap_cmd
specifies on call the command to execute when setting the autopush list.
.I sap_cmd
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B SAP_CLEAR
requests that the autopush list for the \fISTREAMS\fP driver specified by
.I sap_major
and
.I sap_minor
be cleared.
.TP
.B SAP_ONE
requests that the autopush list for the \fISTREAMS\fP driver specified by
.I sap_major
and
.I sap_minor
be set to the modules named in the
.I sap_npush
and
.I sap_list
members.
.TP
.B SAP_RANGE
request that the autopush list for the \fISTREAMS\fP driver specified by the
.I sap_major
and range of minor devices from
.I sap_minor
to
.I sap_lastminor
(inclusive)
be set to the modules named in the
.I sap_npush
and
.I sap_list
members.
.TP
.B SAP_ALL
requests that the autopush list for all minor device of the \fISTREAMS\fP
driver specified by
.I sap_major
be set to the modules named in the
.I sap_npush
and
.I sap_list
members.
.RE
.TP
.I sap_major
on call specifies the major device number of the \fISTREAMS\fP device for
which to set the list of autopush modules; unchanged on return.
.TP
.I sap_minor
on call specifies the minor device number, or initial minor device number in a
range, of the \fISTREAMS\fP device for which to set the list of autopush
modules; unchanged on return.
.I sap_minor
is ignored when
.I sap_cmd
is
.BR SAP_ALL .
.TP
.I sap_lastminor
on call specifies the minor device number, or last minor device in a range for
the \fISTREAMS\fP device for which to set the list of autopush modules;
unchanged on return.
.TP
.I sap_npush
specifies the number of module names in the
.I sap_list
member array; unchanged on return.
.I sap_npush
is ignored when
.I sap_cmd
is
.BR SAP_CLEAR .
.TP
.I sap_list
specifies an array containing
.I sap_npush
module names; unchanged on return.
.I sap_list
is ignored when
.I sap_cmd
is
.BR SAP_CLEAR .

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR apush_set ()
is an
.IR LiS -specific
function.
The macro definition
.B _LIS_SOURCE
must be defined before including
.I STREAMS
header files to expose the prototype for this function.
Also,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must have been compiled with
kernel configuration parameter
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_LIS_COMPAT
defined.
.PP
.BR apush_set ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR apush_set ()
returns zero (0) and the requested function is performed.
Upon failure,
.BR apush_set ()
leaves the autopush list for the device unchanged and returns a negative error
number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR apush_set ()
returns one of the following negative error numbers:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I sap->sap_cmd ", " sap->sap_major ", " sap->sap_minor " or " sap->sap_lasminor
were invalid.
.TP
.RB [ ENODEV ]
a \fISTREAMS\fP character special device did not exist for the specified
.I sap->sap_major " and " sap->sap_minor
combination and a kernel module associated with the device was not
successfully loaded.
.TP
.RB [ EEXIST ]
a device was specified that already has an autopush list and the
.I sap_cmd
was not
.BR SAP_CLEAR .
.TP
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
the device specified is not a \fISTREAMS\fP device.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
resources (an autopush list structure) could not be allocated to complete the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR apush_set ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR apush_set ()
is MP-safe.
The caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
.B strapush
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR apush_set ()
is functionally equivalent to the
.BR SAD_SAP
ioctl to the
.BR sad (4)
driver.
The
.BR apush_set ()
function is a useful way for a driver or module to manipulate the autopush
list associated with a \fISTREAMS\fP driver.
.PP
Calling
.BR apush_set ()
has the kernel module side-effect that if a \fISTREAMS\fP device associated
with
.I sap->sap_major
and
.I sap->sap_minor
does not currently exist in the system, an attempt will be made to load the
character driver associated with
.I sap->sap_major
before return.
No attempt, however, is made to load any kernel modules associated with the
autopush modules in the list.
