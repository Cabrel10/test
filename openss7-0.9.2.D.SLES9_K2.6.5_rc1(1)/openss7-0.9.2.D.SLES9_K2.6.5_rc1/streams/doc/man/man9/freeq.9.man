.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR freeq ()
deallocates a queue pair that was previously allocated with
.BR allocq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR freeq ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR freeq ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR freeq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
Because the queue is flushed before freeing, the same considerations as are given in
.BR flushq (9)
must be taken before calling
.BR freeq ()
from interrupt context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR freeq ()
is MP-safe.  The caller must ensure that it has the last references to the
passed in queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although this function is documented in
.I STREAMS
it is not normally called directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.

.BR allocq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR freeq ()
has no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR freeq ()
is compatible with LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Under LiS,
.BR freeq ()
does not check to see that the queue pair is not still connected in a stream.
.\".PP
.\"Symbol
.\".BR lis_freeq ()
.\"is provided for compatibility with LiS.  See
.\".BR liscompat (9).
.\".BR lis_freeq ()
.\"simply calls
