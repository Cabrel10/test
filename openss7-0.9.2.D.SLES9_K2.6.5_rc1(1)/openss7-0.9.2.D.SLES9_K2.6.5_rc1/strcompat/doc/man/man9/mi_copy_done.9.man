.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _MAC_SOURCE

.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/macddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void mi_copy_done(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp ", int " err );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the current write-side queue whose put or service procedure within which
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is being called.
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the message block that contains the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message being processed.  This is the message that was passed to the write-side put or service
procedure within which
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is invoked.
.TP
.I err
the
.BR ioctl (2)
return value to be set in the
.I ioc_error
field of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure.  This value will be placed in
.BR errno (3)
when the
.BR ioctl (2)
call returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is one of a set of helper functions that support transparent input-output controls (see
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR streamio (9))
that includes
.BR mi_copyin (9),
.BR mi_copyout (9),
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
.BR mi_copy_done (9),
.BR MI_COPY_CASE (9),
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
and
.BR mi_copy_state (9).
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is responsible for cleaning up after a tranparent
.IR ioctl .
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is called to complete the last copy-out of a transparent
.BR ioctl (2)
or for transparent or
.I I_STR
.BR ioctl (2)
when nothing is being copied out.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
When a given
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message does not result in the copy in or copy out of any data, only an optional call to
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
and a call to
.BR mi_copy_done ()
are required.
.PP
The module or driver write put or service procedure should provide a call to
.BR mi_copy_done ()
for any unexpected
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
fails when passed invalid pointers.  When
.BR mi_copy_done ()
fails, it panics the kernel.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
See
.BR mi_copyin (9)
and
.BR mi_copyout (9)
for examples of the usage of
.BR mi_copy_done ().

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common message utility functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copy_done ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copy_done ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_copy_done ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
