.TH T_OPTDATA_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)"
.SH NAME
.B T_OPTDATA_REQ
\- Data request with options
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by zero or more message blocks, where each
.B M_DATA
message block contains zero or more bytes of data.  The format of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_optdata_req {
   t_scalar_t PRIM_type;       /* always T_OPTDATA_REQ           */
   t_scalar_t DATA_flag;       /* flag bits associated with data */
   t_scalar_t OPT_length;      /* options length                 */
   t_scalar_t OPT_offset;      /* options offset                 */
};

.SH DESCRIPTION:
The primitive indicates to the transport provider that the message contains
a transport interface data unit.  One or more transport interface data units
form a transport service data units (TSDU).
.PP
Note that the maximum transport service and data unit sizes allowed by
transport provider is indicated to the user by the
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive.
.PP
This primitive has a mechanism that indicates the beginning and end of a
transport service data unit.  However not all transport providers support
the concept of a transport service data unit.
.PP
This primitive also provides mechanisms to have options associated with the
data being transferred.
.SH PARAMETERS
The fields of this message have the following semantics:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type
.TP
.I DATA_flag
This field specifies bit fields specific general properties associated
with the data being transferred.  The following settings are currently
defined:
.RS
.TP
.B T_ODF_MORE
When set, this bit indicates that the next
.BR T_OPTDATA_REQ (7)
primitive is also part of this transport service data unit.
.RE
.TP
.I OPT_length
the length of the requested options asociated with the primitive
.TP
.I OPT_offset
the offset (from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block) where the options asociated with this primitive begin.
.SH RULES
It is possible to use this primitive with no associated options, in which case
the
.I OPT_length
field is zero.
.PP
The primitive does not require any acknowledgements, although it may
generate a fatal error.  This is indicated via a
.B M_ERROR
message type, which results in the failure of all operating system service
routines on the stream.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.RS
.IP - 3
Thetransport service interface was found to be in an incorrect
state.  If the interface is in TS_IDLE state when the provider receives the
.BR T_OPTDATA_REQ (7)
primitive, then the transport provider should just drop the message without
generating a fatal error.
.IP -
The amount of transport user data associated with the primitive
defines a transport service data unit larger than that allowed by the
transport provider.

.SH MODES
Only connection mode
