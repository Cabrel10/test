.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
allows
.RI non- STREAMS
software to safely call
.I STREAMS
utilities.
.RI Non- STREAMS
code can call
.BR streams_put (),
passing it a function and a queue pointer,
.IR q .
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
runs the function as if it were the queue's
.BR put (9)
procedure.  The function can safely manipulate the queue and access the same data structures as the
queue's
.BR put (9)
procedure.
.BR streams_put ()
passes
.I private
and
.I mp
to
.IR func .
The caller can pass any value it wishes in the
.I private
argument.
The caller must pass a valid message block pointer in
.IR mp ,
because
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
uses fields in the message block not visible to the
.I STREAMS
programmer.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX_MODULE
defined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR streams_put ()
is compatible with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
is an
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR put (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR streams_put ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR hpuxcompat (9)
