.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.B "extern int t_errno;"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
.TP
.I t_errno
the XTI/TLI error number.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I t_errno
contains the last error generated by an XTI/TLI Library call when an XTI/TLI Library
call fails.  (Note: not all XTI/TLI Library calls can fail.)
.PP
If an XTI/TLI Library call succeeds, there is no guarantee that
.I t_errno
will contain the same value as before the call, even though the XTI/TLI Library
call succeeded.  (One exception to this is
.BR t_sysconf (3)).
.PP
