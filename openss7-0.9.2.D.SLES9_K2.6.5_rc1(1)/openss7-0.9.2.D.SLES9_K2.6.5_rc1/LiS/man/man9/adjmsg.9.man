.SH NAME
.B adjmsg, lis_adjmsg
\- trim bytes from the front or back of a \fISTREAMS\fR message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int adjmsg(mblk_t *" mp ", ssize_t " len );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the
.I STREAMS
initial message block representing the message to adjust.
.TP
.I len
the number of bytes to trim and the direction from which to trim.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
trims
.RI abs( len )
bytes from a
.I STREAMS
message pointed to by
.IR mp .
.PP
If
.I len
is less than zero,
.BR adjmsg ()
will trim bytes from the head of the message.
.PP
If
.I len
is greater than zero,
.BR adjmsg ()
will trim bytes from the tail of the message.
.PP
If
.I len
is zero,
.BR adjmsg ()
succeeds but does nothing.
.PP
During the trimming process, blocks are trimmed by advancing the
.I b_rptr
for head trims
.RI ( len "> 0), or ,
decreasing the
.I b_wptr
for tail trims
.RI ( len "< 0),
by the number of bytes trimmed from the block.  If an entire block is trimmed
(its
.I b_rptr
meets its
.IR b_wptr ),
the block is not removed from the chain, but is left as a zero length block.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
is typically used to trim headers and footers off of protocol messages on the
read side of a 
.I STREAMS
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR adjmsg ()
trims the requested number of bytes from the head or tail of the message and
returns true (1).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR adjmsg ()
returns false (0),
and the passed in message remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If
.I mp
is a null pointer,
.I len
is greated that the message size, or if the bytes to trim crosses message blocks of
differing types,
.BR adjmsg ()
will fail and return false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in
message,
.IR mp .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that
.BR adjmsg ()
will not fail due to allocation errors.  Failures depend only on the
characteristics of the passed in message referenced by
.I mp
and the provided
.IR len .
.PP
If the passed in length,
.IR len ,
is zero,
.BR adjmsg ()
will not alter the passed in message and will return true (1).
.PP
Any message blocks that are completely trimmed by
.BR adjmsg ()
are not removed from the message, but have their
.IR b_wptr 's
set to their
.IR b_rptr 's;
that is, the length of the data they contain is set to zero (0).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR adjmsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:

.I LiS

does not free zero length message blocks created or encountered during the
trimming process, and returns success (1) when
.I len
is zero (0).
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg

aixdoc

does nothing if

implementation, use
