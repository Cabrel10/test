.SH NAME
.B wantmsg
\- provide a filter of wanted messages for a \fISTREAMS\fP module
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _AIX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/pse.h>
.HP
.BI "int wantmsg(queue_t *" q ", int(*" f ")(mblk_t *));"
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which filtering is to be performed or cancelled.
.TP
.I f
a pointer to a filter function that accepts a message block pointer as an argument and returns an
integer filter result.  To remove an existing filter,
.I f
is set to
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is used for modules with queues without a service procedure to filter the messages calling the put
procedure of the queue.
.BR wantmsg ()
either installs a filter function for this purpose when the filter function pointer,
.I f ,
is
.RB non- NULL ,
or removes an existing filter function when
.I f
is
.BR NULL .
.PP
When a filter program has been installed with
.BR wantmsg (),
all messages passed to the queue's put procedure will first be passed to the supplied filter
function.
.PP
If the filter function returns true (1), then the message is passed to the queue's put
procedure; if it returns false (0), then the message is passed to the next module in the stream
bypassing the current queue.
.PP
In a multiprocessing kernel,
the filter program is called before attempting to synchronize the queue,
.IR q .
This permits concurrent processing of the filter function and high performance bypass of the queue
processing and queue synchronization for messages that do not need to be processed by the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is particularly useful for optimizing
.I STREAMS
modules with no service procedure that are solely intended to intercept IO controls such as
.BR pipemod (4),
.BR sockmod (4),
and
.BR timod (4).
These modules do not operate on data messages and can install a filter function with
.BR wantmsg ()
that bypasses all messages other than IO control related messages for increased MP performance in
the data stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR wantmsg ()
succeeds, it returns true (1);
when it fails, it returns
false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
fails when the specified queue,
.IR q ,
has a service procedure associated with the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is MP-safe.
.BR wantmsg ()
provides increased performance for MP-STREAMS modules and drivers by determining whether a message
should be processed by a module outside of the synchronization queues for the module.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is a
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _AIX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is implemented in
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
by placing a
.IR q_ftmsg
function pointer member in the
.BR queue (9)
structure.  This pointer is examined by the
.BR put (9)
function in the
.I STREAMS
executive and called when it exists outside before the synchronization queue for the queue.

.\"

.PP
.BR wantio (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR wantmsg ()
is compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR wantmsg ()
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function and it should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR wantmsg ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR AIX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR AIX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR AIX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR wantmsg ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR AIX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR wantmsg ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
