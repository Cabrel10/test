\- \fISTREAMS\fP trail message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_TRAIL
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_TRAIL
message is a normal priority message that consists of a single
.B M_TRAIL
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_TRAIL
message is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg
specific message without documentation.
The generation and use of the message is unknown.
.\"
.PP
.B M_TRAIL
messages cannot be generated directly be a user level process.
.B M_TRAIL
messages arriving at the
Stream head
will be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_TRAIL
messages arriving at a driver may be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_TRAIL
messages should not be generated by drivers or modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B M_TRAIL
messages are not documented, and their use is unknown.
.PP
Guidlelines for processing the
.B M_TRAIL
message are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not recognize an
.B M_TRAIL
message must pass the message along in the same manner as any normal priority message.  That is, it
is subject to flow control and order must be maintained with respect to other normal priority
messages on the queue.
.IP \(bu
A driver that does not recognize an
.B M_TRAIL
message, discards the message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B M_TRAIL
message is documented only by
.IR UnixWare \(rg.
.[
uw7spg

It is provided to assist porting of drivers and modules written for
.IR UnixWare \(rg
to
.BR GNU/Linux .
It might be necessary to define
.B _UW7_SOURCE
before including
.RB < sys/stream.h >
to expose this symbol.  Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_TRAIL
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[

documents the
.BR M_TRAIL "(9), " M_PCCTL "(9) and " M_PCSETOPTS (9)
data block types.
These data block types are provided for source compatibility with drivers
written for
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
It might be necessary to defined
.B _UW7_SOURCE
before including
.B sys/stream.h
to expose these symbols.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.BR M_TRAIL "(9), " M_PCCTL "(9) or " M_PCSETOPTS (9)
data block types.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
