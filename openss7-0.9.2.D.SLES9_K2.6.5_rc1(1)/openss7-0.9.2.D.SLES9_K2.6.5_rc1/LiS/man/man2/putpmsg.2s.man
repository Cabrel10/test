.HP 8
.BI "int " retval " = putpmsg(int " fd ", const struct strbuf *" ctlptr ", const struct strbuf *" dataptr ", int " band ", int " flags );

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor to which to put the message.
.TP
.I ctlptr
a pointer to a
.B strbuf
structure describing the control part of the message.
.TP
.I dataptr
a pointer to a

structure describing the data part of the message.
.TP
.I band
the band for the message.
.TP
.I flags

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B putpmsg()
generates a STREAMS message from the buffer supplied in the specified
.IR ctlptr " and " datapr
for the queue band
.I band
and with options specified by
.I flags
and delivers the message to the stream head associated with the STREAMS
character special file
.IR fd .
.PP
The resulting STREAMS message can contain a control part as specified by
.IR ctlptr ,
a data part as specified by
.IR datptr ,
or both.
The control part, when present, will generate
.BR M_PROTO " or " M_PCPROTO
message blocks.
The data part, when present, will generate
.B M_DATTA
message blocks.
When both control and data parts are present, an
.BR M_PROTO " or " M_PCPROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks will be generated.
.PP
.I fd
is an open file descriptor for the STREAMS character special file to which the
STREAMS message is to be written.
.PP
.IR ctlptr " and " datptr
point to a
.B strbuf
structure, which contains the following members:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
struct strbuf {
    int maxlen;         /* Maximum buffer length.  */
    int len;            /* Length of data.  */
    char *buf;          /* Pointer to buffer.  */
};
\s+2\fR
.fi
.TP 12
.I maxlen
Not used by
.BR putpmsg() .
.TP 12
.I len
The length of the information pointed to by
.IR buf .
.TP 12
.I buf
A pointer to the buffer that contains
.I len
bytes of information.
.PP
.I ctlptr
points to a
.B strbuf
structure describing the control part to be included in the message, or
.B NULL
if there is no control part.
The
.I buf
member
of the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I ctlptr
indiates the start of the information to sent in the control part, and
the
.I len
member indicates the length of the information for the control part.
.PP
.I datptr
points to a
.B strbuf
structure decribing the data part to be included in the message, or
.B NULL
is there is no data part.
The
.I buf
member
of the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I ctlptr
indiates the start of the information to sent in the data part, and
the
.I len
member indicates the length of the information for the data part.
.I len
can be zero (0) to send zero-length data.
.PP
.I band
specifies the queue band to which to write data when
.I flags
is set to
.BR MSG_BAND .
When flags is set to other than
.BR MSG_BAND ,
.I band
must be set to zero (0).
.PP
.I flags
specifies whether to send a high priority message or a band message.
.I flags
can be one of the following values:
.TP 12
.B MSG_HIPRI
Specifies that a high priority message is to be sent if the request contains a
control part
.IR "" ( ctlptr " is not"
.BR "" NULL ).
This results in an
.B M_PCPROTO
message being placed on the stream head.
.TP 12
.B MSG_BAND
Specifies that a normal priority queue band message is to be sent for the
specified
.IR band .
This results in an
.B M_PROTO
message being placed on the stream head when there is a control part.
When there is only a data part, an
.B M_DATA
message for the specified
.I band
is placed on the stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.B putpmsg()
returns zero (0).
.PP
Upon failure,
.B putpmsg()
returns 1 and sets
.I errno
to an appropritate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B putpmsg()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.I errno
to one of the following:
.TP 12
.\".RB [ EACCES ]
.\".I fd
.\"is a dynamic device, and write permission on the device is denied.
.TP 12
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The stream head is set for non-blocking operation and
.B putpmsg()
would block: that is, the message is being sent with
.I flags
set to
.B MSG_BAND
and the corresponding
.I band
is flow controlled.
.TP 12
.RB [ EBADF ]
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.
.TP 12
.RB [ EFAULT ]
.IR ctlptr ", " datptr ", " ctlptr->buf " or " datptr->buf
point outside the caller's address space.
.TP 12
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal arrived before the operation could complete.
.TP 12
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The values of
.IR band " or " flags ,
or the combination of
.IR ctlptr ", " datptr ", and the values of " band " and " flags
were invalid,
such as when
.I flags
is specified as
.B MSG_HIPRI
and
.I band
is non-zero,
or,
.I fd
refers to a stream that is linked under a STREAMS multiplexing driver.
.TP 12
.RB [ EIO ]
I/O error, or,
.I fd
refers to a stream that is open but is in the process of closing, or refers to
a pipe and the other end of the pipe is closed.
.TP 12
.RB [ EISDIR ]
.I fd
refers to a directory.
.TP 12
.RB [ ENODEV ]
.I fd
refers to a device that does not support the
.B putpmsg()
system call.
.TP 12
.RB [ ENOSR ]
STREAMS resources were insufficient to complete the operation.
.TP 12
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
.I fd
refers to a device that has no stream associated with it.
.TP 12
.RB [ ENXIO ]
A
.B M_HANGUP
message arrived at the stream head for the specified
.IR fd .
.TP 12
.RB [ ERANGE ]
The
.I len
of the data part of the message is outside the range
.I q_minpsz
to
.I q_maxpsz
inclusive for the topmost STREAMS module or driver under the stream head, or,
the
.I len
of the control or data part is larger than the maximum sized control or data
message for the STREAMS subsystem.
.PP
Other errors may be returned by
.BR putpmsg() .
If the protocol module sends an
.B M_ERROR
message to the stream head, the error returned on all subsequent write
operations, including
.BR putpsmg() ,
is specified in the
.B M_ERROR
message by the protocol module.  Which errors are returned under what
conditions form part of the necessary documentation of the protocol module.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
could handle concurrent writes better.  Linux socket code blocks concurrent
writers independently while partial writers are installed agains a socket.
When partial writes are performed for messages using
.BR putpmsg() ,
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
should install the partial writer and block all writers from completing the
partial write on a given band until the partial writer completes the write or
the partial writer closes the stream.  This would at least keep multiple
threads of execution from interfering with partial writes.
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
incorrectly returns
.RB [ EINVAL ]
instead of
.RB [ EIO ]
when the internal head queue pointer points to a structure that is not a queue
structure, or is mangled.

.B LiS
.[

.]
does not return
.RB [ EIO ]
when
.B putpmsg()
is called on a closing stream.

.B LiS
.[

incorrectly returns
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
instead of
.RB [ EINTR ]
when an
.B M_SIG
message causes a signal that interrupts the call to
.B putpmsg()
before any data is written.
.PP
.B LiS
.[

.]
incorrectly returns
.RB [ ENODEV ]
instead of
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
when there is no stream associated with
.IR fd .

refers to a device that does not support the
