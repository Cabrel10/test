.SH NAME
.B qsize, lis_qsize
\- return the number of messages on a queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int qsize(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to return the count of the number of
messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR qsize ()
returns zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qsize ()
fails, it returns zero (0).
.BR qsize ()
fails when the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.B NULL
or
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qsize ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
does not maintain the number of messages in a queue in the queue's
.B queue
structure.  Therefore, this function must count the message in the queue each
time that the function is called.  This is inefficient if many calls to
.BR qsize ()
are performed by a given
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.PP
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
returns zero (0) on failure.  It should probably return -1 to indicate failure
to distinguish this from the case where the queue is simply empty.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR strqget (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
maintains a count of the messages on a given queue or queue band in the
.BR queue_t (9)
structure.  Therefore, the messages do not need to be counted when
.BR qsize ()
is called.
.IP ""
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR qsize ()
must lock the queue and walk the buffer chains counting the number of messages
on the queue for each invocation.
.I LiS
is inefficient if many calls to
.BR qsize ()
are performed by a given
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
always succeeds.
.I LiS
returns zero (0) on failure.
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer can panic the system.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer will return zero (0).
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR qsize ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR qsize ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
