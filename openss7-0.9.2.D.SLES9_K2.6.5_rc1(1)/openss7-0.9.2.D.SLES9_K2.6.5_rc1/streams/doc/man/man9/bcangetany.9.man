\- check whether messages are in any (non-zero) band

.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int bcangetany(queue_t *" q ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the
.BR queue (9)
to check for messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
operates like
.BR bcanget (9);
however, it checks for messages in any (non-zero) band, not just in the specified band.  This is
needed by the Stream head for
.BR strpoll (9)
and
.BR I_CKBAND (7)
processing in the Stream head to know when to set the
.B POLLRDBAND
flags (see
.BR poll (2)).
.PP
Also,
.BR bcangetany ()
returns the band number of the highest priority band with messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
is used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
to implement support for the
.BR poll (2s)
system call from the Stream head
.BR strpoll (9)
entry point, as well the
.BR ioctl (2s)
.BR I_CKBAND (7)
operation.

.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
returns the message band number,
.IR b_band ,
of the highest priority, non-zero band, messages on the queue,
.IR q ,
or zero if no normal priority message with a non-zero band,
.IR b_band ,
exists on the queue,
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call-outs, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
is typically called by
.BR strpoll (9)
or
.BR strioctl (9).
.BR strpoll (9)
and
.BR strioctl (9)
are called at process context, where the user is the user that invoked the
.BR poll (2s)
or
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
This function take a
.BR queue (9)
read lock, held while it walks the message queue.  This function cannot be called with a
.BR queue (9)
write lock held or single-party deadlock will result.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR bcangetany ()
is only exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
when loaded as a separate kernel module.  This function should never be invoked directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The current implementation walks the message queue instead of walking queue bands as was done
before.  The current implementation is much faster than the previous approach of waking queue bands,
even considering that there were probably few, if any, queue bands.

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

is compatible with
