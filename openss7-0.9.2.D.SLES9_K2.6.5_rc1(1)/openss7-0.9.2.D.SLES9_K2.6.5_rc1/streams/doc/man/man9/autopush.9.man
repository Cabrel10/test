.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR autopush ()
is a utility called by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
for a driver when a new Stream to the driver has just opened successfully to perform the autopush
operations specified for the Stream.
.PP
The procedure calls
.BR autopush_find (9)
to locate the autopush specification for the driver minor device node, if any.  If there is no
autopush specification for the minor device node, the function succeeds and returns immediately.
Otherwise, each module in the autopush specification is pushed in turn onto the Stream.  If the push
operation should fail for a module, the error code is remembered and every module pushed so far is
popped from the Stream.
.BR autopush ()
then exits, returning the saved error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR autopush ()
is only used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
and should not be used by any portable
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR autopush ()
succeeds, it returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
when it fails, a negative error number indicating the cause of the failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR autopush ()
fails, it returns an negative error number indicating the cause of the failure as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEWOULDBLOCK\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EIO ]
a module on the autopush list could not be located on the system;
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
a module on the autopush list was found, but did not have a
.BR streamtab (9)
structure associated with the module switch table entry,
.BR fmodsw (9);
.PP
In addition, any error returned by
.BR qattach (9)
when called to push the module can be returned by
.BR autopush ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR autopush ()
is called by the Stream head from
.BR stropen (9).
.BR stropen (9)
is invoked in process context and the user is the user that called the
.BR open (2s)
system call that resulted in
.BR stropen (9)
being called.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR autopush ()
is intended to be called only during
.BR stropen (9)
within the Stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR autopush ()
is only exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
when loaded as a separate kernel module.  This function should never be invoked directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
