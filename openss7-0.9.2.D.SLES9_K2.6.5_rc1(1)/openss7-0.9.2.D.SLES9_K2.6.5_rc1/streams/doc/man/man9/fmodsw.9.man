.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B fmodsw
structure contains the following members that
are common with the
.BR devnode (9)
and
.BR cdevsw (9)
structures (a pointer to a
.BR devnode (9)
or
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure can always be cast to a pointer to a
.B fmodsw
structure):
.TP \w'\ f_majors\ 'u
.I f_list
Provides a list of all
.B fmodsw
structures under the control of the
.I STREAMS
executive.
This field must not be populated nor accessed directly by the
.I STREAMS
module.
.TP
.I f_hash
A list of all
.B fmodsw
entries in the same hash slot.
.B fmodsw
entries are hashed for fast lookup by
.I f_modid .
This field must not be populated nor accessed directly by the
.I STREAMS
module.
.TP
.I f_name
The name of the
.I STREAMS
module.  This is the name that will be used for the
.BR specfs (5)
directory entry.  If the
.I STREAMS
module is a loadable kernel module, the kernel module name must also be the concatenation of
.RI \(lq streams- \(rq
and this name for module demand loading to work correctly.  This name should also appear in the
.I f_str->st_rdinit->qi_minfo->mi_idname
member of the
.BR module_info (9)
structure.
.IP ""
Most registration functions require that this member be populated by the caller:
it should be set to point to a constant static character string prior to the call to a registration
function.
.TP
.I f_str
A pointer to a
.BR streamtab (9)
structure specifying the
.I STREAMS
characteristics for the module.  This
.BR streamtab (9)
structure contains the stream head
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures as well as the initial read queue high and low water marks.
.IP ""
Most registration functions require that this member be populated by the caller:
it should be set to point to the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure that properly describes the
.I STREAMS
module.  Members (and subtending structures) of the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure should not be modified directly while the module is registered.
.TP
.I f_flag
See
.IR \*(lqFlags\*(rq ,
below.
.TP
.I f_modid
Contains the module id for this module.  This member is not populated by the caller of a
registration function, but is set by the registration function at registration time.  After
registration has been performed, this is the module id that was assigned to the module.
.TP
.I f_count
The number of opens of this module.  This value must be set to zero before
registration.
.TP
.I f_sqlvl
Synchronization queue level, can be one of the following:
.BR SQLVL_DEFAULT ,
.BR SQLVL_GLOBAL ,
.BR SQLVL_ELSEWHERE ,
.BR SQLVL_MODULE ,
.BR SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR ,
.BR SQLVL_QUEUE ,
.BR SQLVL_NOP " or "
.BR SQLVL_PERSTREAM .
For additional information on these synchronization levels, see
.BR mp-streams (9).
.IP ""
These synchronization levels are not normally populated by the caller of a registration function,
and this member should be allowed to default to zero
.RB ( 0 ),
which is the same as
.BR SQLVL_DEFAULT .
Synchronization should, instead, be specified using the
.I f_flag
member.
.TP
.I f_syncq
A pointer to a synchronization queue,
.BR syncq (9)
structure the describes the outer barrier for synchronization.  This member is only significant when
member
.I f_sqlvl
is set to
.BR SQLVL_DEFAULT ", " SQLVL_MODULE " or " SQLVL_ELSEWHERE .
This member is not set by the caller to a registration function (it is overwritten by the
registration function).  The registration function is responsible for locating the outer barrier
based on other information and populating this pointer.  This member should not be directly
manipulated by the
.I STREAMS
module.
.TP
.I f_kmod
The loadable kernel module (see
.BR kmod (9))
to which this
.B fmodsw
structure belongs.  This kernel module (when non-null) will have its usage
count incremented when stream heads are opened or other reference is made to
the
.B fmodsw
entry.  In addition, this kernel module will have its usage count decremented
when the reference to the
.B fmodsw
structure is released.
When the structure is used to call a registration function by a loadable kernel module, this member
should be populated with the value of
.BR THIS_MODULE .
.\"
.\"
.SS Flags
.PP
The following flags are used in the
.I f_flag
member and are expected to be populated by the
.I STREAMS
driver prior to a call to a registration function:

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B fmodsw
structure is allocated by a caller of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
module registration function,
.BR register_strmod (9).
The
.I STREAMS
driver can call the
.BR register_strmod (9)
function as part of its initialization, or can use one of the registration compatibility function
that will dynamically allocate a
.B fmodsw
structure for the caller.
.PP
The direct caller of the
.BR register_strmod (9)
registration function
can allocate the structure statically or dynamically, but should ensure that all members
are zeroed and only populate the
.IR f_name ", " f_str ", " f_flag " and " f_kmod
members as follows:
.TP \w'f_kmod\(em'u
.I f_name
A pointer to a character string giving the name of the pushable module.
.TP
.I f_str
A pointer to the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure describing the
.I STREAMS
module.
.TP
.I f_flag
Flags specifying the synchronization required by the module.
.TP
.I f_kmod
A pointer to
.BR THIS_MODULE ,
to keep kernel modules from unloading while the
.I STREAMS
module is in use.
.PP
After the registration function has been called, no members of the structure or subtending
structures should be directly accessed nor manipulated by the
.I STREAMS
module.
Dynamically allocated structures cannot be freed until after the corresponding unregistration
function,
.BR unregister_strmod (9),
has been called.
.PP
See the registration function manual page,
.BR register_strmod (9),
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
registration functions are called from blocking context and are intended to be called from a
.I STREAMS
module's initialization or termination functions.  These structures must reside in pinned (kernel)
memory where they are directly accessible by the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
The
.B fmodsw
table is protected by the
.B fmodsw_lock
reader-writer lock.  This structure should never be manipulated directly
after it has been registered with a registration function and before it has
been unregistered with a unregistration function.
It is permissible, however, after registration, to read the values of some members (such as
.IR f_modid ).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.IR "SVR 4" ,
as described in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden Explained" \(rq,
allocates an array of
.B fmodsw
structures (the module switch table), to represent
.I STREAMS
modules in the
.IR UNIX \(rg
system.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses dynamic allocation and a hash list
of
.B fmodsw
structures, instead of an array,
greatly reducing the memory footprint of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.PP
This reduction is particularly noticeable when
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
is compared to
.IR LiS :
.[
lis
.]
.I LiS
allocates a large array of similar
.B cdevsw
and
.B fmodsw
structures to represent
.I STREAMS
character devices and modules, swallowing up an excessive and whopping 600,000 bytes of BSS.
In contrast, the BSS for
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
is about 1400 bytes.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
If a
.I STREAMS
driver or module wishes to register as both a
.I STREAMS
pushable module and a
.I STREAMS
device or pseudo-device driver, it should use separate and distinct
.BR fmodsw " and " cdevsw (9)
structures that are registered separately.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
See
.BR register_strmod (9)
for an example use of the
.B fmodsw
structure.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

The

structure is compatible with the descriptions of internal structures for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4
.]
.[
magic
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.B fmodsw
structure is implementation-specific and should not be manipulated directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
While roughly comparable to other implementations, the
.B fmodsw
structure contains members not present in other implementations and does not contain members present
in other implementations.  Members with the same name may have a different function or other subtle
differences.
.IP \(em
Because the
.B fmodsw
structure is dependent on
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
internal implementation specifics, it is not binary compatible.
.IP \(em
Any use supported by the
.B fmodsw
structure on other systems for purposes other than
.I STREAMS
are explicitly not supported by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.IP \(em
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42
.]
did not standardize on a registration procedure, and most implementations use different methods.
A
.I STREAMS
driver or module can avoid having directly knowledge of this structure by using on of the
