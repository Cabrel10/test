.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I dev
the device number to convert to an internal minor.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
gets the internal device minor number associated with the extern
.B dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
is a SUNDDI specific function intended to replace
.BR getminor (9).
Both are a system independent way for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module to obtain the internal minor device number from the external
device number; however,
.BR getminor (9)
is often implemented as an architecture dependent macro, whereas
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
is an architecture independent function call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
returns the internal minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
is MP-Safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
set.
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
converts the
.BI dev_t " dev"
to an internal
.B kdev_t
and then uses
.BR MINOR (9)
to obtain the internal minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR getminor (9),
.BR MINOR (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ddi_getiminor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because the
.BR dev_t
structure for
.B Linux
differs from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
for additional compatibility information.
