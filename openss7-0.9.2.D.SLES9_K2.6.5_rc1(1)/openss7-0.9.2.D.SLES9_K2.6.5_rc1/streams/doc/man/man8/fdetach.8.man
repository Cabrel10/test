.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options can be used in conjunction with a
.I path
argument:
.TP
.BR -d ", " --debug " [" \fIlevel\fR ]
Increase or specify the debug verbosity level of the output.  This option may
be repeated.
.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet
Suppresses normal output.
.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose " [" \fIlevel\fR ]
Increase or specify the verbosity level of the output.  This option may be
repeated.
.PP
The following options are general command options.  When one of these options is encountered, the
requested information is displayed and
.B fdetach
exits without processing further options or arguments and without performing any other actions.
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
When this option is encountered,
.B fdetach
displays usage information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
.BR -V ", " --version
When this option is encountered,
.B fdetach
displays version information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
.BR -C ", " --copying
When this option is encountered,
.B fdetach
displays copying and copyright information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.PP
If
.B fdetach
is executed without a
.I path
name, a short usage summary is printed.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
[\fIpath\fR]
the path to the file to which the
.I STREAMS
special file is attached.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B fdetach
command detaches or disassociates a file descriptor for an open
.I STREAMS
device or pipe from its filename in the file system.  The path argument is the
path that was previously associated with the file descriptor with the
.BR fattach (3)
function.
.PP
Operations on path will subsequently affect the file system node, not the
.I STREAMS
device or pipe.  The permission and status of the node are returned to the
state that they were in before the
.I STREAMS
device or pipe was attached.  Any other paths that the
.I STREAMS
device or pipe may be attached to are not affected.
.PP
To successfully issue the
.B fdetach
command, the caller must be superuser or must be the owner of the file and
have write permission.
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.B fdetach
returns 0 (zero) on success.  If
.B fdetach
fails, it returns 1 and prints a message to
.IR stderr .
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the
.B fdetach
command was successful; one (1) indicates that an error occurred and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message
is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
Errors may result from inadequate permissions, inability to detach the named
stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B fdetach
simply calls
.BR fdetach (3)
for the specified
.IR path .
