.SH NAME
.B T_DISCON_REQ
\- Disconnect Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks if there is any user data specified by the transport
user.  The format of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_discon_req {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_DISCON_REQ */
    t_scalar_t   SEQ_number;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive requests that the transport provider deny a request for
connection, or disconnect an existing connection.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I SEQ_number
identifies the outstanding connect indication that is to be denied.  If
the disconnect request is disconnecting an already existing connection, then
the value of
.I SEQ_number
will be ignored.
.SH RULES
This primitive requires the transport provider to generate the following
acknowledgment on receipt of the primitive, and the transport user must
wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitives:
.SS Successful
Correct acknowledgment of the primitive is indicated via the
.BR T_OK_ACK (7)
primitive described in reference TPI-SMD. 
.SS Non-fatal errors
These errors will be indicated via the
.BR T_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive described in
reference TPI-SMD.
.SH ERRORS
The allowable errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADSEQ ]
The sequence number specified in the primitive was incorrect or invalid.
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
This primitive is not supported by the transport provider.
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The primitive would place the transport interface out of state.
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the primitive.
.SH MODES
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_DISCON_IND (7),
.BR T_CONN_IND (7),
.BR T_ORDREL_REQ (7),
.BR T_ORDREL_IND (7).
.SH HISTORY
