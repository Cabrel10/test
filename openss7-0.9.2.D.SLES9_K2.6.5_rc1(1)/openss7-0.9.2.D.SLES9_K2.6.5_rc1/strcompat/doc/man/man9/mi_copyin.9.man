.SH NAME
.B mi_copyin
\- copy data from a user buffer
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _MAC_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/macddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void mi_copyin(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp ", caddr_t " uaddr ", size_t " len );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the current write-side queue whose put or service procedure within which
.BR mi_copyin ()
is being called.
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the message block that contains the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message being processed.  This is the message that was passed to the write-side put or service
procedure within which
.BR mi_copyin ()
is invoked.
.TP
.I uaddr
a pointer to the user-space memory address from which data will be copied.  This argument must be
.B NULL
on the first call to
.BR mi_copyin ()
on the original
.BR M_IOCLT (9)
message.  For subsequent calls for
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
messages, this address is extracted from the data structures specific to the input-output control.
.TP
.I len
the number of bytes to copy in from user space.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
is one of a set of helper functions that support transparent input-output controls (see
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR streamio (9))
that includes
.BR mi_copyin (9),
.BR mi_copyout (9),
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
.BR mi_copy_done (9),
.BR MI_COPY_CASE (9),
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
and
.BR mi_copy_state (9).
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
is used to copy data from a user-space to the kernel.  When a module or driver put or service
procedure first receives a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message, the
.BR mi_copyin ()
function is used, if necessary, to generate an upstream
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
request to the stream head.
It may also be used by a module or driver put or service procedure when it receives a subsequent
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message and has additional user-space memory areas to copy in.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
fails when passed invalid pointers.  When
.BR mi_copyin ()
fails, it panics the kernel.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
See
.BR mi_copyin (9)
and
.BR mi_copyout (9)
for examples of the usage of
.BR mi_copyin ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
can be called from any context; however, it is normally called from the
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive access to the passed
in message blocks.  This is normally the case when the function is called from the
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B mi_copyin ()
is implemented by directly manipulating the
.BR iocblk (9),
.BR copyreq (9)
and
.BR copyresp (9)
structures contained in the message block.  Private state information and accumulated data is
chained off of the
.IR cq_private " and " cp_private
members of the
.BR copyreq (9)
and
.BR copyresp (9)
structures.
Because of this, it is important that once one of these helper functions is used to begin an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
sequence, that the remaining help functions be used also, instead of directly manipulating the
structures.  Messages and their contained structures should be passed to the helper functions
without being manipulated in any way by the caller.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR mi_copy_done (9),
.BR mi_copyout (9),
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9),
.BR mi_copy_state (9),
.BR MI_COPY_CASE (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_copyin ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyin ()
is not bug for bug compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.IR OpenSolaris \(rg
has the bug that its implementation of 
.BR mi_copyin ()
will only work correctly on the initial
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message and will fail if used on subsequent
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
messages.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyin ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common message utility functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyin ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyin ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_copyin ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
