.SH NAME
.B T_INFO_REQ
\- Get Transport Protocol Parameter Sizes
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block.  The format of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_info_req {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_INFO_REQ */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive requests the transport provider to return the sizes of all
relevant protocol parameters, plus the current state of the provider.
.PP
Note that the
.B T_INFO_REQ
and
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7)
primitives have no effect on the state of the transport provider and do
not appear in the state tables. 
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
indicates the primitive type.
.SH RULES
This primitive requires the transport provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments on receipt of the primitive and that the transport
user wait for the acknowledgment before issuing any other primitives:
.IP \- 4
.B Successful:
Acknowledgment of the primitive via the
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7).
.IP \-
.B Non-fatal errors:
There are no errors associated with this primitive.
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_INFO_ACK (7),
.BR T_ADDR_REQ (7),
.BR T_ADDR_ACK (7),
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ (7),
.BR T_CAPABILITY_ACK (7).
