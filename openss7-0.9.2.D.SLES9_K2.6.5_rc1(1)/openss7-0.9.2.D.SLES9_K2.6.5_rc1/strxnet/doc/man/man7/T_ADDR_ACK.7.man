.SH NAME
.B T_ADDR_ACK
\- Protocol Address Acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s+1\
struct T_addr_ack {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_ADDR_ACK */
    t_scalar_t   LOCADDR_length;
    t_scalar_t   LOCADDR_offset;
    t_scalar_t   REMADDR_length;
    t_scalar_t   REMADDR_offset;
};
\fR\s-1

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the transport user the local and remote protocol
addresses currently associated with the transport endpoint.
.SH PARAMETERS
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
the primitive type.
.TP
.I LOCADDR_length
the length of the local address associated with the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I LOCADDR_offset
the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block where the local address begins. 
.TP
.I REMADDR_length
the length of the remote address associated with the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I REMADDR_offset
the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block where the remote address begins. 
.PP
The proper alignment of the addresses in the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block is not guaranteed. 
.SH RULES
If the transport endpoint is not bound to a local address, the
LOCADDR_length field is set to 0.
.PP
If the transport endpoint is not associated with a remote address, the
REMADDR_length field is set to 0.
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
