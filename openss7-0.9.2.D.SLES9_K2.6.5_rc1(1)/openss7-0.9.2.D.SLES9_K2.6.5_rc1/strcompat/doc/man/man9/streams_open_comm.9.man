.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I size
Size (in bytes) of the private data structure to allocate and attach to the
.I q->q_ptr
for each queue in the queue pair.
.TP
.I q
The read queue of the queue pair as directly obtained from the
.BR qopen (9)
call.
.TP
.I devp
The pointer to the device number as directly obtained from the
.BR qopen (9)
call.
.TP
.I oflag
The open flags as directly obtained from the
.BR qopen (9)
call.
.TP
.I sflag
The streams flags as directly obtained from the
.BR qopen (9)
call.
.TP
.I crp
The pointer to the credentials structure as directly obtained from the
.BR qopen (9)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is a convenience or housekeeping function used within a module or driver's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure to allocate a private data structure of size
.I size
and a minor device number when
.I sflag
is set to
.BR CLONEOPEN .
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
differs from
.BR streams_open_ocomm (9)
in that
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is used for
.I "SVR 4"
.[
svr4
.]
style open functions.
.PP
When
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is called from the module's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure, a corresponding call to
.BR streams_close_comm (9)
is required in the module's
.BR qclose (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR streams_open_comm ()
succeeds, it returns zero (0);
when it fails, it returns a non-zero error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR streams_open_comm ()
fails it returns a positive error code as follows:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EIO ]
.I sflag
is set to
.B MODOPEN
but there is no
.I WR(q)->q_next
pointer, or
.I sflag
is set to
.B CLONEOPEN
or
.B DRVOPEN
but there is a
.I WR(q)->q_next
pointer and the stream is not a FIFO.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
The private structure of size
.I size
could not be immediately allocated.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
The minor device number is in use and
.B CLONEOPEN
was not specified in
.IR sflag .
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
.I sflag
was
.B CLONEOPEN
or a clone minor was opened, however, no minor device numbers are available.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
can be called from any context, however, it is only normally called from the
module's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure at user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is mp-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is a
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function:
.B _OSF_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is closely related to the
.IR AIX \(rg
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
convenience function.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following is an example of the use of the
.BR streams_open_comm ()
convenience function in a module's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1
int
xxx_open(queue_t *q, dev_t *devp, int oflag, int sflag, cred_t *crp)
{
    xxx_priv_t *p;
    int err;
    err = streams_open_comm(sizeof(*p), q, devp, oflag, sflag, crp);
    if (err != 0)
        return (err);
    p = q->q_ptr;
    /* initialize some more stuff in p */
    return (0);
}

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is compatible with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is an
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_open_comm ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_open_comm ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR streams_open_comm ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
