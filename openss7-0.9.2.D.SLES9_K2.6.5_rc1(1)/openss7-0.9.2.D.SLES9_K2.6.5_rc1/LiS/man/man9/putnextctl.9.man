.SH NAME

\- puts a control message on the downstream \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int putnextctl(queue_t *" q ", int " type );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue upstream of the queue to which to put the control message.
.TP
.I type
the type of the control message to put.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putnextctl ()
creates a zero-length control message of type
.I type
and invokes the put procedure of the queue next to the queue pointed to
by
.I q
to place the message on the subsequent queue.
If
.I type
is a data message type and not a control message type,
.BR putnextctl ()
will fail.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putnextctl ()
returns true (1).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putnextctl ()
returns false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putnextctl ()
failes and returns false (0) if the specified
.I type
is not a control message type, or if the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
or has a
.I q_next
pointer of
.BR NULL ,
or if allocation of the necessary message block fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putnextctl ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putnextctl ()
is MP-safe.

implements
.BR putnextctl ()
as a call to

with a queue pointer of
.IR q->q_next .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.BR putnextctl ()
will return success even if the operation fails because of the following
conditions:
.IR q " and " q->q_next
are not
.BR NULL ,
but
.I q->q_next
points to something other than a queue structure;
the queue pointed to by
.I q->q_next
has a
.I q_info
pointer of
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointed to by
.I q->q_next
is closing, or the queue has had put and service routine processing turned off
(e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.I LiS
.[
LiS

should return failure when the operation fails.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR putnextctl ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
