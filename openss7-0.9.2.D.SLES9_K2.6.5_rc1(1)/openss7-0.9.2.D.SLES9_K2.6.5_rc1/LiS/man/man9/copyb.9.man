\- copy a \fISTREAMS\fR message block
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "mblk_t *copyb(mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message block to copy.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR copyb ()
generates a new copy of the message block and data block and buffer indicated
by
.IR mp ,
and returns a pointer to the new message block.
The new data block has the same type as the copied data block and the
.IR b_rptr " and " b_wptr
in the new message block are set to the beginning and end of the copied data
in the new data block and buffer.
.PP
The data buffer copied consists of only the portions between the
.I b_rptr
and
.I b_wptr
of the passed in message block.
.PP
.BR copyb ()
calls
.BR allocb (9)
to copy message blocks with priority
.BR BRPI_MED .
Message alignment and memory type assurances are as described in
.BR allocb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR copyb ()
returns a pointer to the new message block.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR copyb ()
returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR copyb ()
fails, it returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.BR copyb ()
can fail because the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
the size of the data buffer is negative;
the size of the data indicated by
.IR b_rptr " and " b_wptr
of the message block to be copied is negative;
or memory allocation failed.
Normally if
.B copyb
fails,
.BR bufcall (9)
should be called with the
.I size
of the data block necessary and the
.I priority
associated with the operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR copyb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR copyb ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure exclusive access to the passed in
message block.  On return, the caller has the only reference to the returned
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implementation of
.BR copyb ()
will fail if the block to be copied has a negative message length (i.e. the
.I b_wptr
is less than the
.IR b_rptr ),
or if the data block is mangled (i.e.  the 
.I db_lim
pointer is less than the
.IR db_base ).
.PP
This does not appear consistent with SVR 4.2 STREAMS.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR copyb ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR copyb ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementattions based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR copyb ()
copies both the
.I b_band
and
.I b_flag
members of the passed in message block to the returned message block.
Older versions of
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
did not copy
.I b_band
or
.I b_flag
members.  Recent versions copy both.
.IR AIX \(rg
copies
.IR b_band ,
but not
.IR b_flag ,
members.
.IR Solaris \(rg
copies both
.I b_band
and
.I b_flag
members.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers should not rely on any
.BR msgb (9)
fields being copied into the returned message block and should copy or
reinitialize all significant fields (such as
.IR b_band " and " b_flag ).
.IP \(em
.BR copyb ()
aligns the new data buffer in the same manner as if
.BR allocb (9)
was called and the data was copied between
.IR db_base " and " db_lim .
(See
.BR msgb "(9) and " datab (9)).
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
make no assurances whatsoever about the resulting alignment.
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
restores the same alignment in the copy as the original data to a word
boundary.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers should make no assumptions about the alignment of data
resulting from a
.BR copyb ()
or
.BR copymsg (9)
operation.
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
