.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block from the input output control operation to be processed, normally passed into the
write-side queue put or service procedure.
.TP
.I db
a pointer to a message block containing
.I count
bytes of data to be attached to the message, or,
.BR NULL ,
if the message block representing the data is already attached to the message block passed in as
.IR mp .
.TP
.I count
the count of the number of bytes of data contained in the attached or passed in message block.
.TP
.I rval
the return value to return from the
.BR ioctl (2)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
transforms the passed in
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block,
.IR mp ,
into a
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message block to be passed upstream by the caller.  Also,
.BR mioc2ack ()
optionally attaches a message block,
.IR db ,
containing data to be attached to the message.  The count and return value set in the
resulting
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message will be set to
.IR count " and " rval .
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
only transforms the passed in message block to a valid
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message: it is the responsibility of the caller to place the message on the appropriate queue after
the function returns.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
is used in processing of
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
and
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
messages when performing
.BR ioctl (2)
processing in a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedures.  It is used to acknolwedge the
completion of a
.BR ioctl (2)
operation and return a value with data attached to the
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message block.
.PP
It is not normal in the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
implementation to even need to pass a
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
message with data back to the stream head.  Typically, the message would not include data and the
.BR miocack (9)
function could be used in its stead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
always succeeds; however, when passed an invalid pointer or argument,
.BR mioc2ack ()
has indeterminate results and could destabilize the kernel or cause immediate or delayed panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
can be called from any context; however, it is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive access to the passed
in message blocks.  This is normally the case when
.BR mioc2ack ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure with a message block that was passed to those
procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.

.SH BUGS

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mioc2ack ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mioc2ack ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
For maximum portability, the message blocks and structures should be manipulated directly using
standard
.I STREAMS
utilities in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mioc2ack ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mioc2ack ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mioc2ack ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
