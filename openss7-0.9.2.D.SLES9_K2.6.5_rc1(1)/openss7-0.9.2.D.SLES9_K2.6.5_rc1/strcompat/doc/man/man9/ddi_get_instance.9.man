.PP
.TP
.I dip
A pointer to the device
.B dev_info
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
returns the instance number of the device corresponding to
.IR dip .
.PP
The system assigns an instance number to every device.  Instance numbers for
devices attached to the same driver are unique.  This provides a ways for the
system and the driver to uniquely identify one or more device of the same
type.  The instance number is derived by the system from different properties
for different device types in an implementation specific manner.
.PP
Once an instance number has been assigned to a device, it will remain the same
even across reconfigurations and reboots.  Therefore, instance numbers seen by
a driver may not appear to be in consecutive order.  For example, if device
.B foo0
has been assigned an instance number of 0 and device
.B foo1
has been assigned an instance number of 1, if
.B foo0
is removed,
.B foo1
will continue to be associated with instance number 1 (even though
.B foo1
is now the only device of its type on the system).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:

.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR ddi_get_instance ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
