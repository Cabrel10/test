.SH NAME

\- test for \fISTREAMS\fR pipe or fifo
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int SAMESTR(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to test for being a stream end.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
tests whether the next queue belongs to the same stream as the specified
queue
.IR q .
.BR SAMESTR ()
can be used to detect whether or not
.I q
belongs to a
.BR pipe (3)
or a
.BR fifo (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
returns true (1) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
belongs to the same stream (read or write) as the specified queue
.IR q .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is not a
.BR pipe (3)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
returns false (0) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
belongs to a different stream (read or write) as the specified queue
.IR q .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is a
.BR pipe (3)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
also returns false (0) if the next queue from the specified queue,
.IR q->q_next ,
is
.BR NULL .
In this case, the queue
.I q
is a stream end (stream head or driver).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR SAMESTR ()
fails, it returns
zero (0).
.BR SAMESTR ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q->q_next
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q->q_next
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
.BR SAMESTR ()
as a function rather than as the more obvious
macro:
.sp
.nf
#define SAMESTR(__q) (__q->q_flag & QREADR) == (__q->q_next->q_flag & QREADR)
.fi
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
function call is inefficient, particularly as this function is called often
and regularly.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR SAMESTR ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR SAMESTR ()
is defined for
.IR UnixWare \(rg,

.IR Solaris \(rg,

.[
hpuxspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,

.]
.IR LiS .

These systems also support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe "(4) and " fifo (4).
.IP \(em
.BR SAMESTR ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR SAMESTR ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
This is presumably because
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
allows frozen streams to manipulate the
.I q->q_next
pointers directly.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
on the other hand, does not allow
.I q->q_next
pointers to be manipulated directly and provides the
.BR weldq (9)
function to perform that action.
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR SAMESTR ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR SAMESTR ()
is not defined for
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR UXP/V \(rg.
.[
uxpspg
.]
These systems do not support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe "(4) and " fifo (4).
.BR SAMESTR ()
is not very useful on systems that do not support
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
