.HP
.BI "void SLEEP_LOCK_SIG(sleep_t *" lockp ", int " priority );

.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'priority\(em'u
.I lockp
A pointer to the
.B sleep_t
sleep lock structure to acquire.
.TP
.I priority
A hint to the scheduler as to the relative priority at which the caller wishes
to run after acquiring the sleep lock.
The priority values are:
.RS
.TP \w'pridisk\(em'u
.B pridisk
A priority for a disk driver.
.PD 0
.TP
.B prinet
A priority for a network driver.
.TP
.B pritty
A priority for a terminal driver (including
.IR STREAMS ).
.TP
.B pritape
A priority for a tape driver.
.TP
.B prihi
A high priority.
.TP
.B primed
A medium priority.
.TP
.B prilo
A lo priority.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR SLEEP_ALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_DEALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKAVAIL (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKOWNED (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG (),
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK (9)
and
.BR SLEEP_UNLOCK (9),
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, initializing,
acquiring, releasing and testing sleep locks of type
.BR sleep_t .
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
acquires the sleep lock pointed to by the
.I lockp
argument.  If the lock is not immediately available, the calling process will
block until the lock is acquired.
.PP
A caller sleeping on
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
waiting to acquire a lock will awaken when a signal is received.  To
not awaken to a signal, see
.BR SLEEP_LOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
returns true (1) when the lock was acquired;
otherwise, it returns false (0) to indicate that sleeping on the lock was
interrupted by a signal.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is always successful.  If passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, the
results are indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
can be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
An attempt to use
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
to acquire a sleep lock that is already held by the caller will result in
single-party deadlock.
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is implemented
by calling
.BR down_interruptible (9)
on the
.B sleep_t
semaphore.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR SLEEP_ALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_DEALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKAVAIL (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK (9),

.BR down_interruptible (9)
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK (9),
.BR SLEEP_UNLOCK (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
ignores the
.I priority
argument, which is a scheduler hint.
.B Linux
does not schedule in the same manner as
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" .
.IP \(em
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
response to job control signals or
.B SIGSTOP
resulting in the stopping of the sleeping process might differ from that
described for
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" .
.IP \(em
A priority of
.B plbase
corresponds to interrupts enabled under
.BR Linux .
.IP \(em
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
