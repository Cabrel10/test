.SH NAME
.B M_PASSFP
\- \fISTREAMS\fP pass file pointer message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_PASSFP
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains structured data.
.PP
An
.B M_PASSFP
message is a normal priority message that consists of a single
.B M_PASSFP
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_PASSFP
message is used internally by
.I STREAMS
to pass a file pointer from the
Stream head
at one end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
to the
Stream head
at the other end of the same
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4).
.PP
The message is generated as a result of an
.BR I_SENDFD (7)
command to an
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call issued by a user level process to the sending
Stream head.
.I STREAMS
places the
.B M_PASSFP
message directly on the destination
Stream head's
read queue to be retreived by an
.BR I_RECVFD (7)
command to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
The message is placed without passing it through the
Stream
(i.e., it is not seen by any drivers or modules in the
Stream).
This message should never be present on any queue except the read queue of a
Stream head.
Consequently, drivers and modules do not need to recognize this message, and it can be ignored by
driver and module developers.
.PP
There are several reasons why the
.B M_PASSFP
message is placed directly on the opposite
Stream head:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
The message contains a reference to a file pointer (file table entry) within the kernel and must not
be freed without also releasing this reference.
.IP (2)
The message must not be altered by modules in the
Stream.
.IP (3)
Although the message contents are structured, the contents rely on implementation specifics of the
Stream head.
Therefore, the message is of no use to a portable driver or module.
.PP
Because the
.B M_PASSFP
message is placed directly on the opposite
Stream head,
although it is message of normal priority, it is treated as a high priority message.
.\"
.B M_PASSFP
messages can be generated directly by a user level process with the
.BR I_SENDFD (7)
.BR ioctl (2s).
.B M_PASSFP
messages can be consumed directly by a user level process with the
.BR I_RECVFD (7)
.BR ioctl (2s).
.B M_PASSFP
messages should not be generated by drivers or modules.
.B M_PASSFP
messages arriving at a driver or module can be discarded (ignored and freed).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
There is one standard module (besides the
Stream head)
that needs to generate an pass a
.B M_PASSFP
message.  That module is
.BR connld (4).
The
.BR connld (4)
module must pass a file pointer to the
Stream head
opposite to the one that is is pushed over, on each open of the
Stream.
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
implementation of the
.B M_PASSFP
message is detailed below, under
.RI \(lq IMPLEMENTATION \(rg
as documentation for this module and any other module that needs to perform a similar task.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.PP
Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
.[
lfs
.]
the
.B M_PASSFP
message contains (indirectly)
a file pointer (that is, a pointer to a
.B file
structure as defined in
.RB < linux/fs.h >).
The
Stream head
allocates the message block using the
.BR esballoc (9)
utility instead of
.BR allocb (9).
The free routine and argument to the free routine are special.  The free routine argument is the
file pointer, and the free routine simply releases the reference to the file pointer.
Rather than pointing into the data buffer,
.I b_rptr
points to the free routing argument contained in the
data block,
.BR datab (9),
structure, and
.I b_wptr
points one byte past the argument.
.PP
In this way,
.B M_PASSFP
messages sitting on a
Stream head
read queue can be flushed as normal, using the
.BR flushq (9)
utility, and the reference to each file pointer will be released.

.BR msgb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_PASSFP
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Contents of the
.B M_PASSFP
message and implementation of the
.BR sth (4)
and
.BR connld (4)
modules are, by nature, implementation specific.  Neither can be implemented in a fully portable
manner.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not expect the
.B M_PASSFP
message to appear on their queues, and will never generate an
.B M_PASSFP
message.
.IP \(em
.B M_PASSFP
has a different constant value on
older versions of
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
and older versions of
.IR LiS .
.[
lis
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs

instead of
.IR LiS .
