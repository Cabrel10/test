.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void unbufcall(int " bcid );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I bcid
the buffer call identifier returned by
.BR bufcall (9)
or
.BR esbbcall (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
cancels the buffer callback that was installed using
.BR bufcall "(9) or " esbbcall (9).
.I bcid
is the buffer callback identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR bufcall "(9) or " esbbcall (9).
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is typically used to remove outstanding buffer calls when a stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bufcall ()
silently fails if the buffer callback identified by
.I bcid
no longer exists;
or, 
.I bcid
is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Because the module is permitted to unload after calling
.BR unbufcall ()
for all outstanding buffer callbacks the call to
.BR unbufcall ()
will not return until either the callback function has completed, or the
callback function has been cancelled.  Therefore the callback function will be
guaranteed not to run once 
.BR unbufcall ()
has returned for all outstanding callbacks.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
can be called with a
.I bcid
returned by
.BR bufcall (9),
or
.BR esbbcall (9).
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
must be called for all outstanding buffer calls from the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure of the module before exiting or unloading.
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
uses rather inefficient linear lookups with interrupts disabled while looking
for the
.I bcid
in the list of buffer callbacks.  As buffer callbacks should be rare in most
.I STREAMS
driver and module designs, this is of little moment.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR esbbcall (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Unfortunately,
under
.IR LiS ,
.[
LiS
.]
.BR unbufcall ()
returns immediately when a callback is being executed without cancelling the callback.  This makes
the function rather unusable on
.IR LiS .

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unbufcall ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,

and systems based on
.I SVR 4

In
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4spg
.]
.BR unbufcall ()
was redefined to accept a
.B bcid_t
.I bcid
instead of an
.B int
.I bcid
as was the case for
.IR "SVR 3" .
.[
svr3spg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc

ues a
.B bufcall_id_t
instead.
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc

and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
.[
uxpdoc
.]
use
.B register int
for
.IR bcid .
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfdoc

uses a plain
.BR int .

.IR UnixWare \(rg

and

implementation, use
