.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strconf.h>
.HP
.BI "unregister_strdev(struct cdevsw *" cdev ", major_t " major );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'major\(em'u
.I cdev
a pointer to a
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure indicating the characteristics for the driver.
All members of the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure, pointed to by
.IR cdev ,
are significant.
.I cdev
must point to a 
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure previously registered with
.BR register_strdev (9).
.TP
.I major
the (external) character major device number to unregister, or zero (0),
indicating that all registered character major device numbers for this driver
are to be unregistered.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
deregisters the
.I STREAMS
device described by the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure,
.IR cdev ,
from the character major device number specified by
.IR major .
.PP
.I major
can also be set to zero (0)
to indicate that the
.I STREAMS
executive should unregister all character major device numbers currently
associated with the
.I STREAMS
device,
.IR cdev .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
can be called multiple times for the same device driver with different
selections of the
.I major
device number.  This has the effect that multiple (external) character major
device numbers will be disassociated with the
.I STREAMS
device.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unregister_strdev ()
unregisters the
.I STREAMS
driver described by
.I cdev
and returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR unregister_strdev ()
does not effect unregistration and returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unregister_strdev ()
fails to unregister the specified
.I STREAMS
driver, it returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I cdev
was
.BR NULL ,
or the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure referenced contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I major
is invalid
.RB ( ">= MAX_CHRDEV" ).
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
.I cdev
does not reference a registered
.I STREAMS
driver.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
.I major
is not registered to a device.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
.I major
is registered to a driver other than that referenced by
.IR cdev .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
can be called from any blocking context.  Consideration for import on
performance and latency should be given before calling
.BR unregister_strdev ()
from soft or hard interrupt context.  Typically,
.BR unregister_strdev ()
is called from the
.BR module_exit (9)
procedure of a kernel module associated with a
.I STREAMS
device.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Loadable kernel modules that call
.BR regsiter_strdev (9)
when loading must call
.BR unregister_strdev ()
before unloading.
.BR unregister_strdev ()
must be called with the same value of
.I cdev
with which
.BR register_strdev (9)
was called.
.PP
Drivers unregistered with
.BR unregister_strdev ()
will no longer appear in
.BR /proc/streams/devices .
.PP
Drivers unregistered with
.BR unregister_strdev ()
will also disappear as a device directory in
.BR /dev/streams ,
when the
.BR specfs (5)
filesystem has been mounted on
.BR /dev/streams .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unregister_strdev ()
is a
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
implementation specific function.  Registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules is inherently implementation specific and non-portable.
Different implementation provide different mechanisms.
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for mechanisms compatible with other implementations
and additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Registration and unregistration of
.I STREAMS
drivers is implementation specific and not subject to standardization.
.BR unregister_strdev ()
is a
