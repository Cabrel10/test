.SH NAME
.B drv_usecwait
\- delay for a number of microseconds
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP
.BI "void drv_usecwait(clock_t " usec );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I usec
the number of microseconds to wait.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
spins the calling processor until the specified number of microseconds,
.IR usec ,
elapses.
.BR drv_usecwait ()
is an SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
DDI/DKI D3DK function intended to insulate the
.I STREAMS
driver or module from the internals of the underlying operating system
implementation.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
returns
.BR void .
.BR drv_usecwait ()
returns once the specified number of microseconds,
.IR usec ,
have elapsed.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
simply calls
.BR udelay (9).
.BR udelay (9)
is implemented by spinning the processor in a calibrated timing loop.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Consideration must be made that
.BR drv_usecwait ()
will spin the calling processor until the specified number of microseconds has 
elapsed.
.BR drv_usecwait ()
should never be called with interrupts disabled except for extremely short
periods of time.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
can be called from any context
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR udelay (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR drv_usecwait ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
