## The following symbols are exposed by the header files (to ctags) but are only
## conditionally exposed.  These symbols would generate an unexported symbol
## error unless we list them here and tell check_decls about them.  We use
## AM_EXPOSED_SYMBOLS here and leave the EXPOSED_SYMBOLS susbtitution variable
## available to configure.  We should actually use configure to assemble this
## list: that is, when we check for support for the symbol and find that it is
## not supported, we should add it to the EXPOSED_SYMBOLS list in configure.
## We list them here manually for the moment.
##
# Can't support qwait or qwait_sig on LiS without additional support from LiS.
# Use SV_WAIT in qopen/qclose and SV_SIGNAL or SV_BROADCAST in put or srv
# procedure instead.
