.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I name
the name of the queue to allocate.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Allocate a new
.BR NULL -initialized
queue pair.
Queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq ()
can be freed with
.BR freeq (9).
.PP
Queue pairs allocated with
.BR allocq ()
will have no putp, srvp, open or close procedures associated with either
queue, will have zero maximum and minimum packet sizes and high and low water
marks; and will have no synchronization queues associated with the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.BR allocq ()
returns the newly allocated queue pair as a pointer to the
read queue of the pair,
.BR lis_allocq ()
take as the
.I name
argument, a name to associate with the queue structure for debugging purposes.
.IR q .
.BR allocq ()
returns
.B NULL
on failure.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR allocq ()
returns
.B NULL
on failure.
.BR allocq ()
fails when the queue pair cannot be allocated.

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR allocq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR allocq ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned queue pair.
