.SH NAME
.B unregister_clone
\- unregister a clone minor
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "int unregister_clone(struct cdevsw *" cdev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to a character device switch table,
.BR cdevsw (9),
structure describing the
.I STREAMS
driver for which to remove a clone device minor.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
locates the minor device number of the
.BR clone (4)
driver associated with the
.I STREAMS
device specified by
.I cdev
that was registered using
.BR register_clone (9),
and calls
.BR unregister_strnod (9)
for that device node.
.BR unregister_clone ()
then frees the memory associated with the
.BR devnode (9)
structure that was allocated by the call
to
.BR register_clone (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is probably not the function that you want.  See
.BR unregister_strdev (9).
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
is called automatically by
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
to unregister a clone device minor
in the
.BR specfs (5)
file system for every
.I STREAMS
device driver unregistering for an external major character device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unregister_clone ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure, a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unregister_clone ()
fails, it returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEWOULDBLOCK\fR]\(en'u
.RB [ ENXIO ]
the minor device node
.BR devnode (9)
structure does not exist.
.PP
In addition,
.BR unregister_clone ()
can return any error number returned by
.BR unregister_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
is intended to be called from a blockable process context during just prior to the unloading of a
.I STREAMS
kernel module and as part of the deallocation of that kernel module.
It may also be called at blockable process context as part of a
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.BR unregister_clone ()
is MP-safe when called from the proper context.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
is a convenience function that simply locates the
.BR devnode (9)
structure,
and unregisters it with
.BR unregister_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific
function that is not intended to be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  This is certainly not the utility you need: see
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
and
.BR unregister_strnod (9).
.PP
Loadable kernel modules that call
.BR register_clone (9)
when loading must call
.BR unregister_clone ()
before unloading.
.BR unregister_clone ()
must be called with the same arguments with which the corresponding
.BR register_clone (9)
was called.
.PP
Drivers unregistered with
.BR unregister_clone ()
will no longer appear as a minor device node in the
.B /dev/streams/clone/
directory, visible when the
.BR specfs (5)
file system has been mounted on
.BR /dev/streams.
.PP
If you use
.BR unregister_clone ()
from outside of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package, your code may break on the next release.
Do not use
.BR unregister_clone ():
use
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
or
.BR unregister_strnod (9)
instead.

.PP

.IR qi_qclose (9),
.BR unregister_strnod (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unregister_clone ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function with support for the mountable
.BR specfs (5)
file system.  Registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules is inherently implementation specific and non-portable.
Different implementations provide different mechanisms.
The
.BR strcompat (5)
package for
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides additional mechanisms compatible with other implementations.
See also
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Registration and de-registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers is implementation specific and not subject to standardization.
.BR unregister_clone ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function.
