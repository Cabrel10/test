* Major changes for streams-0.7a.6.rc2

  Second release candidate.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a.6rc1

  Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a.6

  Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
  Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a.5

  This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
  architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
  distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

  - Changes to wait queues.  Split single wait queue into four
    independent wait queues.  Reworked wait queues for both old style
    (2.4) and new style (2.6) semantics.

  - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

  - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
    mailing list.  Build and run tested on FC4 i686 and x86_64 kernels
    based on 2.6.15.

  - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
    x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
    compiler warnings.

  - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
    Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
    N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

  - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
    x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

  This is a public beta test release of the package.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a.4

  This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
  testing.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a.3

  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
  version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.
  All `RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all
  `Debian' release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches
  and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply
  a suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
  release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
  source in the `.dsc' file.

  Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
  and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
  distribution support.

  This was an internal beta test release and was not released publicly.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a-3

  Updates to common build process.  Documentation updates.

  This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a-2

  Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and
  documentation from streams distribution and set epoch at 0.  Linux
  networking code has been migrated to the strxnet, strinet and strsctp
  packages.  The purpose for doing this was to allow the Linux
  networking to build against `Linux Fast-STREAMS' as well as `Linux
  STREAMS' and is a preparation for phasing out LiS and phasing in LfS.

  This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.

* Major changes for streams-0.7a-1

  This is the initial release of the Linux Fast-STREAMS package for
  Linux.  This is intended as a high-performance, production replacement
  for `Linux STREAMS (LiS)'.  Linux Fast-STREAMS has the following
  features:

   - optimized for Linux kernels.
   - prepared for mainstream Linux kernel adoption.
   - lindented and follows kernel coding practices.
   - compatibility modes for AIX, HPUX, OSF, Solaris, UnixWare, SVR 4.2
     and LiS.
   - supports all major SVR4.2 variants.
   - licensed under GPL with commercial licensing available.
   - supports full SVR 4.2 MP synchronization models.
   - runs at SoftIRQ.
   - provides common SVR 4.2 system tunable parameters and sysctls.
   - provides /proc filesystem access for debugging and performance
     tuning.
   - provides a full set of common STREAMS modules and drivers.
   - provides full name-streams device and shadow special filesystem
     support.

  This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
