.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_getprotaddr(int " fd ", struct t_bind *" loc ", struct t_bind *" rem );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint for which to retreive protocol addresses.
.TP
.I loc
a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure to contain the returned local address.
.TP
.I rem
a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure to contain the returned remote address.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint for which to retrieve address
information.
.PP
.I loc
is a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure that returns the local endpoint transport address bound to
.IR fd ,
if
.I fd
is in a bound state.
.PP
.I rem
is a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure that returns the remote endpoint transport address connected to
.IR fd ,
if
.I fd
is in a connected state.
.PP
The
.B t_bind
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_bind {
        struct netbuf addr;
        unsigned int qlen;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_bind
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that specifies the local or remote address.

.I loc->addr.maxlen
is significant on call and
.I loc->addr.len
is significant on return.
If
.I loc->addr.maxlen
is zero on call, then the local address will not be returned.
When a local address is returned,
.I loc->addr.len
will be non-zero on successful return.

.I rem->addr.maxlen
is significant on call and
.I loc->addr.len
is significant on return.
If
.I rem->addr.maxlen
is zero on call, then the remote address will not be returned.
When a remote address is returned,
.I rem->addr.len
will be non-zero on successful return.
.TP
.I qlen
this member is not used by
.BR t_getprotaddr ()
in either
.IR loc " or " rem
structures and remains unchanged from call to return.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_getprotaddr ()
is valid in any state other than
.BR T_UNINT .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_getproaddr ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_getproaddr ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_getproaddr ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.IR loc->addr.maxlen " or " rem->addr.maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available
local or remote address.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
