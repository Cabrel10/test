The

structure contains the following members:
.PP
The following members are members that the
.B devnode
structure has in common with the
.BR fmodsw (9)
and
.BR cdevsw (9)
structures (permitting a pointer to one to be cast to a pointer to the other):
.TP \w'\ n_majors\ 'u
.I n_list
Provides a list of all
.B devnode
structures belonging to the same driver.
.TP
.I n_hash
A list of all
.B devnode
entries in the same hash slot.
.B devnode
entries are hashed for fast lookup by
.IR n_major .
.TP
.I n_name
The name of the device node.  For minor device nodes, this is the name that will be used for the
.BR specfs (5)
entry beneath the driver's directory entry.
.TP
.I n_str
A pointer to a
.BR streamtab (9)
structure specifying the
.I STREAMS
characteristics for the driver.
Ignored for device nodes, this pointer is a cached copy of the driver's
.BR cdevsw (9)
member.
.TP
.I n_flag
Contains the flags for this node.
Ignored for device nodes, these flags are a cached copy of the driver's
.BR cdevsw (9)
member.
.TP
.I n_modid
Contains the module id for this node.
Ignored for device nodes, this module id is a cached copy of the driver's
.BR cdevsw (9)
member.
.TP
.I n_count
The number of opens of this node.
Ignored by device nodes, always set to zero
.RB ( 0 ).
.TP
.I n_sqlvl
Synchronization queue level.
Ignored for device nodes, a cached copy of the driver's
.BR cdevsw (9)
member.
.TP
.I n_kmod
The loadable kernel module.
Ignored for device nodes, a cached copy of the driver's
.BR cdevsw (9)
member.
.PP
The following members are members that the
.B devnode
structure has in common with the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure (permitting a pointer to one to be cast to a pointer to the other):
.TP \w'\ n_majors\ 'u
.I n_major
The node major device number.  This is the major device number allocated to this node.
.TP
.I n_inode
This member is a pointer to the
.BR specfs (5)
device node
.B inode
that is allocated to the
.I STREAMS
device node.
.BR register_strnod (9),
directly or indirectly, during registration.
.TP
.I n_mode
Specifies the mode of the device node.  This mode is set by the registration function and can differ
from the driver's mode in both permission and format.
.PP
The following members are specific to the
.B devnode
structure:
.TP \w'\ n_majors\ 'u
.I n_minor
The minor device number for this node (if this is a minor device node, and zero
.RB ( 0 )
if this is a major device node).
.TP
.I n_dev
A back pointer to the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure, representing the driver for this device node.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B devnode
structure is allocated and deallocated by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
registration, unregistration, and DDI functions that affect major and minor device nodes.  A
.B devnode
structure is created for every external major device number.  A devnode structure is also created
for every named minor device node within the
.BR specfs (5)
file system.
.PP
This manual page is provided for information purposes only.  The
.I STREAMS
driver should never directly access this structure.  The registration functions
.BR register_cmajor (9),
.BR register_xnode (9),
.BR register_strnod (9),
.BR register_inode (9)
should be used intead.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.B devnode
structures are not be be accessed by the
.I STREAMS
driver in any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
The
.B cdevsw
table is protected by the
.B cdevsw_lock
reader-writer lock.  This structure should never be manipulated or examined directly.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B devnode
structure is an internal structure that results from device node registration functions and is not
to be examined or manipulated by the
.I STREAMS
driver.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B devnode
structure is a
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
implementation specific structure, not to be accessed by the user, and is guaranteed incompatible
with all other implementations.  It is, however, used to support specific
.IR Solaris \(rg
DDI compatibility functions.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
