.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP

the size of the requested data buffer.

.I priority
the priority of the request for a message block.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR testb ()
tests whether an allocation made with
.BR allocb (9)
of the size specified by
.I size
and priority specified by
.IR priority ,
will succeed or fail.
To test whether a subsequent allocation with
.BR esballoc (9)
will succeed or fail, set
.I size
to zero (0).
.PP
.I priority
can be one of the following values:
.sp
.TS
tab(:);
lblsss.
BPRI_LO:T{
requests a low priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_MED:T{
requests a medium priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_HI:T{
requests a high priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_WAITOK:T{
requests a low priority buffer and can block.
T}
.TE
.PP
If
.I priority
is other than
.BR BPRI_LO ", " BPRI_MED ", " BPRI_HI " or " BPRI_WAITOK ,
the request will be treated as
.BR BPRI_LOW .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR testb ()
returns true (1) if the allocate would succeed, and returns false (0) if the
allocation would fail.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR testb ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR testb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR testb ()
is MP-safe.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
As with other post
.I SVR 3 STREAMS
.[
svr3
.]
implementations,
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
ignores the
.I priority
argument to
.BR testb () .
The message block
.I priority
was an
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
concept which was found not to be useful, primarily due to
priority inversion.  For a history of the
.I priority
mechanism and a discussion as to why the mechanism was abandoned in
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,

.]
see
.I \*(lqThe Magic Garden Explained\*(rq
section 7.7.2.
.[
magic
.]
.PP
.BR testb ()
can only test whether the allocation would succeed at a given moment in time.
It cannot indicate what would happen immediately following return from
.BR testb ().
Therefore, the return from
.BR allocb "(9) and " esballoc (9)
must always be tested for
.BR NULL .

.SH BUGS

.SH COMPATIBILITY

is compatible with
.I "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[

with the following portability considerations:
