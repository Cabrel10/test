.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "SPLSTR(pl_t " pl ");"
.HP
.BI "pl_t lis_splstr(void);"
.HP
.BI "pl_t lis_splstr_fcn(char *" file ", int " line ");"
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I pl
a priority level into which to save the previous priority level.
.TP
.I file
The file where the function was called, typically
.BR __FILE__ .
.TP
.I line
The line number in the file, typically
.BR __LINE__ .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR splstr ()
returns the priority level that was in effect before the
.BR splstr ()
function was called.
.BR spl5 ()
is normally equivalent to
.BR splstr ().
.PP
.BR SPLSTR ()
is a macro under
.I LiS
that is simply defined as:
.sp
.BI "#define SPLSTR(" __x ") (" __x ") = lis_splstr()"\fR.
.PP
.BR lis_splstr_fcn ()
is a debugging function that takes additional debugging information as arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The following code snippet illustrates the use of the
.BR splstr ()
function:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
{
	pl_t save_pl = splstr();

	/* do some stuff */

	splx(save_pl);
}
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When the
.BR splstr ()
function succeeds, it sets the calling processor's priority level and returns the priority level
that was in effect prior to the call; when
.BR splstr ()
fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR splstr ()
fails when it is not possible to set the specified priority level.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR splstr ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR splstr ()
is MP-safe, however, it does not perform well in an MP environment and is almost
always not what the author intended.  It is wiser to use basic or read-write
locks for mutual exclusion, rather than relying on suppression of local bottom
half or hard interrupts for serialization.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I LiS
implementation of
.BR splstr ()
simply saves flags to the
.I pl
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR splstr ()
and family are
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
functions.
.PP
There is, in fact, only one
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.I STREAMS
driver that uses this function, and that is the
.BR ldl (4)
driver.  Also, the
.BR ldl (4)
driver misused this function, and has been converted to no longer use it.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR splstr ()
uses a combination of enabling or disabling using local bottom half suppression and hard irq
suppression.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR SPL0 (9),
.BR SPLX (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR splstr ()
does not follow
.I SVR 4.2
.[
svr42
.]
rules for arguments of type
.BR pl_t .
In particular, it does not follow the ordinality rules for arguments of this
type.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR splstr ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR splstr ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR splstr ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR splstr ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
