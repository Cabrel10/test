\- test a \fISTREAMS\fP data block for data type
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int isdatablk(dblk_t *" dp ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I dp
the data block to test for data type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tests whether the data block pointed to by
.I dp
has a data block type.  Data blocks have data type when they are of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
returns true (1) if the data block pointed to by
.I dp
is of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
returns false (0) if the data block pointed to by
.I dp
is not of type
.BR M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9), " M_PCPROTO "(9) or " M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for protecting the integrity of the passed in message block.
.\"

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR datamsg (9),
.BR isdatablk (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR isdatablk ()
is implemented as an
.BR "extern inline" .
Some implementations, such as
.IR LiS ,
implement
.BR isdatablk ()
as a macro.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not attempt to take a function pointer reference to
.BR isdatablk ().
.IP \(em
Some
.I LiS
versions have a typographical error in the macro definition that render it unusable.
.BR isdatablk ()
is binary compatible with
.I LiS
(versions without the typographical error).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
instead of
.IR LiS .
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
