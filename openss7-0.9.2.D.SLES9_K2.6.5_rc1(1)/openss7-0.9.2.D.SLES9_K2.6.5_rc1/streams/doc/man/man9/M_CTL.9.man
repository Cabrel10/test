.SH NAME

\- \fISTREAMS\fP control message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_CTL
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_CTL
message is a normal priority message that consists of one
.B M_CTL
message block followed by zero or more
message blocks of unspecified type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_CTL
message is generated by modules that wish to send information to a particular module or type of module.
.B M_CTL
messages are typically used for inter-module communication, as when adjacent
.I STREAMS
protocol modules negotiate the terms of their interface.
.PP
.B M_CTL
is a normal priority message that is subject to flow control within a
Stream.
Intermediate modules are expected to maintain the ordering of
.B M_CTL
messages with respect to data messages
.RB ( M_PROTO (9),
.BR M_DATA (9)).
.\"
.B M_CTL
messages cannot be generated by a user level process.
.B M_CTL
message arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_CTL
messages can be generated by drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Guidelines for processing the
.B M_CTL
message are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not recognize an
.B M_CTL
message must pass the message along in the same manner as ordinary normal priority messages.  That
is, they are subject to flow control and must retain their order with respect to other normal
priority messages within the
Stream.
.IP \(bu
A driver that does not recognize an
.B M_CTL
message, discards the message.
.IP \(bu
A driver or module processing an
.B M_CTL
message does so with regard to the definitions agreed upon between modules.
.PP
Although
.B M_CTL
messages are unstructured and can be used for inter-module communication in a manner defined by the
modules involved, the intended use of
.B M_CTL
messages is to provide an inter-module communication mechanism similar to that provided by the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message when communicating with a user level process.
For example, the
.BR ldterm (4)
module uses
.B M_CTL
messages in this fashion.
Under
.BR ldterm (4),
the
.B M_CTL
message consists of one
.B M_CTL
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
The
.B M_CTL
message block contains an
.BR iocblk (9)
strucuture, formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct iocblk {
    int ioc_cmd;        /* ioctl command type */
    cred_t *ioc_cr;     /* full credentials */
    uint ioc_id;        /* ioctl identifier */
    ulong ioc_count;    /* byte count for ioctl data */
    int ioc_error;      /* error code for M_IOCACK/NAK */
    int ioc_rval;       /* return value for M_IOCACK */
    long ioc_filler[4]; /* reserved for future use */
#define ioc_flag ioc_filler[1]; /* IOC_NATIVE or IOC_ILP32 */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
where,
.TP \w'ioc_count\(em'u
.I ioc_cmd
contains a command that is defined between modules.  The value of the command indicates whether the
message corresponds to a request or a reply.
.TP
.I ioc_cr
contains a pointer to the user credentials, if any;
.B NULL
otherwise.
.TP
.I ioc_id
contains a transaction identifier associating request and reply, generated by the requesting module.
.TP
.I ioc_count
contains a count of the data contained in the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks attached to the initial message block.
.TP
.I ioc_error
contains an error number for a reply, a default error number for a request.
.TP
.I ioc_rval
contains a return value for a reply.
.PP
Using this definition, modules designed after the
.BR ldterm (4)
module can use the
.B M_CTL
message to perform actions on downstream modules in response to
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message received from the user level process.
.PP

.BR iocblk (9)

.BR ldterm (4)

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The

.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B M_CTL

Portable
