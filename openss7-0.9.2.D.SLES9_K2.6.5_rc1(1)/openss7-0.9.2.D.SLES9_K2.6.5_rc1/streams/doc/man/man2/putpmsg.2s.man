.BI "int putpmsg(int " fd ", const struct strbuf *" ctlptr ", const struct strbuf *" dataptr ", int " band ", int " flags );
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor to which to put a message.
.TP
.I ctlptr
a pointer to a
.B strbuf
structure holding the control part of the message.
.TP
.I dataptr
structure holding the data part of the message.
.TP
.I flags
putmsg flags.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putpmsg ()
generates a
.I STREAMS
message from the buffer supplied in the specified
.IR ctlptr " and " datapr
for the queue band
.I band
and with options specified by
.I flags
and delivers the message to the stream head associated with the
.I STREAMS
character special file
.IR fd .
.PP
The resulting
.I STREAMS
message can contain a control part as specified by
.IR ctlptr ,
a data part as specified by
.IR datptr ,
or both.
The control part, when present, will generate
.BR M_PROTO " or " M_PCPROTO
message blocks.
The data part, when present, will generate
.B M_DATTA
message blocks.
When both control and data parts are present, an
.BR M_PROTO " or " M_PCPROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks will be generated.
.PP
.I fd
is an open file descriptor for the
.I STREAMS
character special file to which the
.I STREAMS
message is to be written.
.PP
.IR ctlptr " and " datptr
point to a
.B strbuf
structure, which contains the following members:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
struct strbuf {
    int maxlen;         /* Maximum buffer length.  */
    int len;            /* Length of data.  */
    char *buf;          /* Pointer to buffer.  */
};
\s+2\fR
.fi
.TP
.I maxlen
Not used by
.BR putpmsg ().
.TP
.I len
The length of the information pointed to by
.IR buf .
.TP
.I buf
A pointer to the buffer that contains
.I len
bytes of information.
.PP
.I ctlptr
points to a
.B strbuf
structure describing the control part to be included in the message, or
.B NULL
if there is no control part.
The
.I buf
member
of the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I ctlptr
indiates the start of the information to sent in the control part, and
the
.I len
member indicates the length of the information for the control part.
.PP
.I datptr
points to a
.B strbuf
structure describing the data part to be included in the message, or
.B NULL
is there is no data part.
The
.I buf
member
of the
.B strbuf
structure pointed to by
.I ctlptr
indiates the start of the information to sent in the data part, and
the
.I len
member indicates the length of the information for the data part.
.I len
can be zero (0) to send zero-length data.
.PP
.I band
specifies the queue band to which to write data when
.I flags
is set to
.BR MSG_BAND .
When flags is set to other than
.BR MSG_BAND ,
.I band
must be set to zero (0).
.PP
.I flags
specifies whether to send a high priority message or a band message.
.I flags
can be one of the following values:
.TP
.B MSG_HIPRI
Specifies that a high priority message is to be sent if the request contains a
control part
.RI ( ctlptr " is not"
.RB NULL ).
This results in an
.B M_PCPROTO
message being placed on the stream head.
.TP
.B MSG_BAND
Specifies that a normal priority queue band message is to be sent for the
specified
.IR band .
This results in an
.B M_PROTO
message being placed on the stream head when there is a control part.
When there is only a data part, an
.B M_DATA
message for the specified
.I band
is placed on the stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putpmsg ()
returns zero (0).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putpmsg ()
returns -1 and sets
.I errno
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR putpmsg ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.I errno
to one of the following:
.TP
.\".RB [ EACCES ]
.\".I fd
.\"is a dynamic device, and write permission on the device is denied.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The stream head is set for non-blocking operation and
.BR putpmsg ()
would block: that is, the message is being sent with
.I flags
set to
.B MSG_BAND
and the corresponding
.I band
is flow controlled.

A

The
.I len
of the data part of the message is outside the range
.I q_minpsz
to
.I q_maxpsz
inclusive for the topmost
.I STREAMS
module or driver under the stream head, or,
the
.I len
of the control or data part is larger than the maximum sized control or data
message for the

subsystem.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.RB [ ENOSYS ]
The
.BR putpmsg ()
system call is not supported on your system.  The occurs when
.I STREAMS
is not
loaded or you have linked the wrong library.
.PP
Other errors may be returned by
.BR putpmsg ().
If the protocol module sends an
.B M_ERROR
message to the stream head, the error returned on all subsequent write
operations, including
.BR putpmsg (),
is specified in the
.B M_ERROR
message by the protocol module.  Which errors are returned under what
conditions form part of the necessary documentation of the protocol module.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.SS Multi-Threading
.PP
.BR putpmsg ()
is thread-safe; however, multiple threads performing concurrent partial writes
on the same stream will interfere with each other.  POSIX mandatory file
locks, (see
.BR lockf (3)),
can be used to avoid interference.
.SS "Asynchronous I/O"
.PP
If the file is set for blocking operation (see
.BR fcntl (2)),
then
.BR putpmsg ()
will block waiting for the band specified in
.I band
(with
.B MSG_BAND
set in
.IR flags )
to permit sending messages under band flow control.
.RB ( putpmsg ()
will not wait for a message block to formulate the
.I STREAMS
message, but will return
.RB [ ENOSR ]
if it cannot allocate the necessary message block).
When the file is set for non-blocking operation,
.BR putpmsg ()
will not block, but will return the appropriate error number
.RB ([ ENOSTR "], [" EAGAIN "], [" EWOULDBLOCK ])
if the
.I STREAMS
message could not be formulated and sent immediately.
