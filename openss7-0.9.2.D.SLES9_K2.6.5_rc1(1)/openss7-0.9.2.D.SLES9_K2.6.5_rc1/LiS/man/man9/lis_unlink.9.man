.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int lis_unlink(char *" pathname );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I pathname
the pathname of a file to remove.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unlink ()
is an
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
wrapper function to the system call
.BR unlink (2)
that can be called from the kernel.
.PP
The purpose of this function being called from the kernel is to permit
.I STREAMS
kernel modules to create their own character special devices in the
.B /dev
directory and dynamically allocate device major numbers to those devices.
.PP
Normally, a character special device would be created by a
.I STREAMS
module or driver when the
.B Linux
kernel module loads (i.e. within the
.BR init_module ()
function).
Normally,
.BR unlink ()
would be called within the kernel module
.BR cleanup_module ()
function to remove the character special devices that were created during
module intialization.
.PP
The arguments to
.BR unlink ()
are the same as for
.BR unlink (2).
.PP
.I pathname
is the path to the file to remove.
.PP
For additional information, see
.BR unlink (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unlink ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR unlink ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unlink ()
fails, it returns a negative error number that can contain any of the errors
listed under
.BR unlink (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unlink ()
must be called from user (process) context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR unlink ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR unlink ()
is implemented by changing the data segment to the kernel data segment and
calling
.BR mount (2).
This means that the
.BR uid " and " euid
of the caller is not changed.
This makes this function rather useless if the process invoking it is not the
kernel module loading daemon, or other process running with real root
permission, and a potential security breach otherwise.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR unlink (2),
.BR lis_mount (9),
.BR lis_umount2 (9),
.BR lis_mknod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Under GCOM releases of
.IR LiS ,
.BR unlink ()
will not function and will panic the kernel on architectures that do not have a simple call
interface for system calls (e.g. parisc).
.PP
Previous and current OpenSS7 releases of
.I LiS
do not have this problem.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unlink ()
is compatible with
.BR unlink (2).
