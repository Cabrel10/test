.SH NAME

\- attempt to acquire a read/write lock in write mode
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "pl_t RW_TRYWRLOCK(rwlock_t *" lockp ", pl_t " pl );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the read/write lock to attempt to acquire in write mode.
.TP
.I pl
A priority level to set if required before attempting to acquire the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
sets the priority level specified by the
.I pl
argument using
.BR spl (9)
and then attempts to acquire the read/write lock specified by the
.I lockp
argument in write mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
If the lock cannot be acquired immediately,
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
restores the previous priority level and returns a value of
.BR invpl .
If the lock can be acquired immediately,
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
returns the prevailing priority level at the time that
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
was called.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is always successful.  If
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, the results will by
indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
It is not necessary to raise the priority level using the
.I pl
argument if there is never an attempt to take a read or write lock on
.I lockp
from an interrupt service routine context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Read/write locks of type
.B rwlock_t
are not fully recursive.  Calling
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
for a read/write lock that has been locked for read or write by the calling
processor with
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
will result in single part deadlock.
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is implemented by calling
.BR spl (9)
with the
.I pl
argument and then testing the lock with
.BR write_trylock (9).
If
.I lockp
was unlocked, a write lock was taken
and the old interrupt priority level returned from
.BR spl (9)
is returned to the caller.
If
.I lockp
was locked,
.B invpl
is returned.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),

.\".BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
has a race due to a missing
.BR write_trylock ()
primitive in
.BR Linux .
It is possible that the function will spon on
.I lockp
rather than returning failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for more compatibility information.
