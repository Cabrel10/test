.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
allocates a
.BR linkblk (9)
link block structure for use in performing regular and persistent linking of Streams beneath a
multiplexing driver as part of an
.BR I_LINK (7)
or
.BR I_PLINK (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation.
.PP
.BR freelk ()
frees the
.BR linkblk (9)
structure allocated with
.BR alloclk ().
.SS /proc File System
.PP
A
.BR linkblk (9)
is dynamically allocated for every Stream linked under a multiplexing driver.
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
monitor the number of
.BR linkblk (9)
link blocks currently allocated, and the high water mark for allocations since the last reboot.
The counts and high water mark can be viewed in
.BR proc (5)
file system under
.BR /proc/streams/strinfo .
See
.BR strinfo (5)
for details. 
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
are internal functions, and are not recommended for direct use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
is used by the
Stream head
to allocate a link block.  The link block is used by the
Stream head
both for populating an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message block for use by the
.BR I_LINK (7),
and
.BR I_PLINK (7),
input-output controls, as well as for tracking
Streams
that are linked under a multiplexing driver.
.BR freelk ()
is used to free the link block allocated with
.BR alloclk ().
.PP
For details of the link block structure,
see
.BR linkblk (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR alloclk ()
will return a link block.
Upon failure,
.BR alloclk ()
will return a 
.BR NULL
pointer.
.PP
.BR freelk ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR alloclk ()
will return a
.B NULL
pointer.
.BR alloclk ()
fails when there is insufficient cache memory to satisfy the allocation request.
.PP
.BR freelk ()
always succeeds when passed a valid
.I l
link block pointer.
When passed an invalid link block pointer, the results of
.BR freelk ()
are indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call outs, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.PP
Care should be taken before calling
.BR alloclk ()
or
.BR freelk ()
from an ISR.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
are MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned link block.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
are internal functions, and are not recommended for direct use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
allocate from and free to a private memory cache.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
are compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
%P Chapter 7
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
do not export this function.
.IP ""
.BR alloclk ()
and
.BR freelk ()
are
.I STREAMS
internal implementation specific functions and will not be used directly by
portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
Source and binary compatibility is not guaranteed, even from version to version, or release to
release.

.BR STREAMS (9)
