.SH NAME
.B T_CONN_CON
\- Connection Confirm
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by zero or more
.B M_DATA
blocks if any user data is associated with the primitive.  The
format of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_conn_con {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_CONN_CON         */
    t_scalar_t   RES_length;     /* Responding address length */
    t_scalar_t   RES_offset;
    t_scalar_t   OPT_length;
    t_scalar_t   OPT_offset;
};

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the user that a connect request has been
confirmed on the specified responding address.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I RES_length
is the length of the responding address that the connection was accepted.
.TP
.I RES_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block) where the
responding address begins. 
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the confirmed options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block) of the
confirmed options associated with the primitive. 
.PP
The proper alignment of the responding address and options in the
.B M_PROTO
message block is not guaranteed. 
.SH MODES
Only connection-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_CONN_REQ (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transport Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
