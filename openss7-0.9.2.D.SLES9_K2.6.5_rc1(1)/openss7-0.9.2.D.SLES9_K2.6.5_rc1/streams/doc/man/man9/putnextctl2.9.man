.SH NAME

\- put a two byte control message on the downstream \fISTREAMS\fR message queue

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int putnextctl2(queue_t *" q ", int " type ", int " param1 ", int " param2 );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to put the control message.
.PD 0
.TP
.I type
the type of the control message.
.TP
.I param1
a one-byte parameter to place in the first byte of the control message.
.TP
.I param1
a one-byte parameter to place in the second byte of the control message.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
creates a two-byte control message of type
.I type
with the two-byte data containing the data
.IR param1 " and " param2 ,
and calls
.BR putnext (9)
for the queue pointed to by
.I q
to place the message on the subsequent queue.
If
.I type
is a data message type
.RB ( M_DATA "(9), " M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9))
and not a control message type,
.BR putnextctl2 ()
will fail.
Note that
.BR putnextctl2 ()
can succeed for message type
.BR M_DELAY (9),
which is normally a data message type according to
.BR datamsg (9).
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
allocates the message block for the message with priority
.BR BPRI_HI ,
[see
.BR allocb (9)].
.BR putnextctl2 ()
fails if message block allocation fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
is used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules to pass simple messages that contain a two-byte data buffer [e.g.,
.BR M_ERROR (9)]
along a Stream.  However,
.BR putnextctl2 ()
is not normally used by the Stream head because it will not block awaiting the availability of a
message block.  For passing messages to a Stream end,
.BR putctl (9)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putnextctl2 ()
returns
.I true
.RB ( 1 ).
Upon failure,
.BR putnextctl2 ()
returns
.I false
.RB ( 0 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
fails and returns
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
if the specified
.I type
is not a control message type, or if the allocation of the necessary message blocks fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines;
however, see the considerations listed under
.BR putnext (9).
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
must be called from a
.I STREAMS
synchronous context for the Stream containing
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
is MP-safe when called from the proper context.  However, the caller is responsible for ensuring the
validity of the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q .
See also the considerations listed under
.BR putnext (9),
and
.BR mp-streams (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR putnextctl2 ()
can succeed with a
.I type
argument of
.BR M_DELAY (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Message blocks allocated by
.BR putnextctl2 ()
are allocated with priority
.BR BPRI_HI ,
and passed along the Stream with
.BR putnext (9).

lists
.BR putnextctl2 ()
as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
also lists
.BR putnextctl2 ()
as a utility that cannot be called from user functions or
.RI non- STREAMS
code; that is, contexts asynchronous to the Stream containing
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR HP-UX \(rg
compatible drivers and modules will not call
.BR putnextctl2 ()
from outside of a
.BR qinit (9)
routine for the queue pair of
.IR q .
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
