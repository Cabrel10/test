.SH NAME
.B accept
\- accept a new connection on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int accept(int " socket ", struct sockaddr *" address ", socklen_t *" address_len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR accept ()
function extracts the first connection on the queue of pending connections,
creates a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as
the specified socket, and allocates a new file descriptor for that socket.
.PP
The function takes the following arguments:
.TP
.I socket
Specifies a socket that was created with
.BR socket (3),
has been bound to an
address with
.BR bind (3),
and has issued a successful call to
.BR listen (3).
.TP
.I address
Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a sockaddr structure where the address
of the connecting socket will be returned.
.TP
.I address_len
Points to a socklen_t which on input specifies the length of the supplied
sockaddr structure, and on output specifies the length of the stored address.
.PP
If address is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted
connection is stored in the sockaddr structure pointed to by address, and the
length of this address is stored in the object pointed to by address_len.
.PP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied
sockaddr structure, the stored address will be truncated.
.PP
If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is not
bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to by address is
unspecified.
.PP
If the listen queue is empty of connection requests and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is not set
on the file descriptor for the socket,
.BR accept ()
will block until a connection is present. If the
.BR listen (3)
queue is empty of
connection requests and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is set on the file descriptor for the
socket,
.BR accept ()
will fail and set errno to
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
or
.RB [ EWOULDBLOCK ].
.PP
The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The original socket
remains open and can accept more connections.
.SH NOTES
.PP
When a connection is available,
.BR select (2)
will indicate that the file
descriptor for the socket is ready for reading.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR accept ()
returns the non-negative file descriptor
of the accepted socket. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR accept ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN "] or [" EWOULDBLOCK ]
.B O_NONBLOCK
is set for the socket file descriptor and no connections are
present to be accepted.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ ECONNABORTED ]
A connection has been aborted.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The address or address_len parameter can not be accessed or written.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
The
.BR accept ()
function was interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid connection
arrived.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The socket is not accepting connections.
.TP
.RB [ EMFILE ]
{OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
The maximum number of file descriptors in the system are already open.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSOCK ]
The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The socket type of the specified socket does not support accepting
connections.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
No buffer space is available.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
There was insufficient memory available to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There was insufficient STREAMS resources available to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
A protocol error has occurred; for example, the STREAMS protocol stack has not
been initialised.
