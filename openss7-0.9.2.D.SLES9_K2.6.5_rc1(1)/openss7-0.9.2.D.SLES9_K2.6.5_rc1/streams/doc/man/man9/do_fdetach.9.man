\- implement the \fBfdetach\fR(2) system call

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "long do_fdetach(const char *" path ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'\fIpath\fR\(em'u
.TP
.I path
the path to the mounted Stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
is a
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
internal implementation specific function that
detaches the mounted Stream located at
.IR path .
Detaching a mounted Stream causes the Stream to be closed and dismantled if no process has the Stream open.
See
.BR fdetach (2)
and
.BR close (2s).
If a process has the Stream open,
.BR do_fdetach ()
only serves to detach the Stream from
.I path
in the file system.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
is used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module, to emulate the
.BR fdetach (2)
system call using the
.BR I_FDETACH (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
call.
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
has no other use or purpose, and will not be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules other than the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR do_fdetach ()
detaches the Stream from
.I path
and returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure,
it returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR do_fdetach ()
fails, the Stream is not unmounted from the specified path, and
.BR do_fdetach ()
returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOENT ]
.I path
is
.BR NULL
or is a null string.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
nothing is mounted on
.IR path .
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
the file or special file mounted on
.IR path
is not a
.I STREAMS
special file (i.e., not a Stream).
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
the calling user is not capable of unmounting Streams.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
the calling user does not own the Stream to be unmounted.
.PP
Any error returned by
.BR path_lookup ().
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOENT ]
a component of
.I path
does not exist.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
a component of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.RB [ ELOOP ]
too many symbolic links encountered while traversing the path.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
a component of
.I path
is too long (longer than
.BR MAXPATHLEN ).
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
a component of
.I path
was not searchable.
.\".PP
.\"Any error returned by
.\".BR do_umount ().
.\".TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.\".RB [ EBUSY ]
.\".I path
.\"specifies a node that is busy.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
can only be invoked in user process context.  Note that this does include kernel module
initialization and termination routines as well as
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
open routines
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
close routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
is an internal
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
function intended to provide the back-end to a
.B Linux
system call.
It is only exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
for
.BR ioctl (2s)
emulation of the
.BR fdetach (2)
system call, when
.BR sth (4)
is configured as a separate loadable kernel module.  (The symbol need not be exported otherwise.)
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules calling this function that exist outside the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
package, might be broken from verion to version and release to release.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR do_fdetach ()
is implemented simply by using the
.B Linux
kernel's ability to mount files on files and then unmount them (using
.BR do_umount ()).
