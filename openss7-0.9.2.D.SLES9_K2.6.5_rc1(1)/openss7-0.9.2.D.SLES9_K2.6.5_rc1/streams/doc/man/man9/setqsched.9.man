.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void setqsched(void);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
invokes the
.I STREAMS
scheduler, causing it to run at some time in the future.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that should not be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  It is intended for use by inline functions for
.BR enableq (9)
and
.BR qenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
can be called from any context, including process context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
is not intended to be called directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  It is only intended to be used directly by inlined
.I STREAMS
utilities.
.PP
Calling
.BR setqsched ()
without the wrapping
.I STREAMS
utility, that indicates to the
.I STREAMS
why it is being run and gives it some work,
is futile.  The
.I STREAMS
scheduler will run, but will have nothing to do.
Do not call this function directly.
Call
.BR enableq (9)
or
.BR qenable (9)
instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
When running under kernel threads,
.BR setqsched ()
wakes up the
.I STREAMS
scheduler kernel thread on the current processor.
.PP
When running under soft interrupt,
.BR setqsched ()
wakes up the
.B softirq
daemon on the current processor.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR runqueues (9),
.BR qenable (9),
.BR enableq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR setqsched ()
is compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4",
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP"
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4"
do not export this function.
.IP \(em
Source and binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.IP \(em
This implementation may do more or less than the equivalent
.IR "SVR 4"
function.
.IP \(em
.BR setqsched ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.

.SH CONFORMANCE

.BR setqsched ()
function of
