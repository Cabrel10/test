.SH NAME
.B WR
\- return the write queue of a \fISTREAMS\fR queue pair
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *WR(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to either the read or write queue of a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR WR ()
returns the write queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the write queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.PP
.BR WR ()
is typically and often used to find the write queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR WR ()
returns a pointer to the write queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR WR ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR WR ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR WR ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q->q_other
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q->q_other
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR WR ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR WR ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
.BR WR ()
as a function rather than as the more obvious
macro:
.sp
.nf
#define WR(__q) __q->q_flags & QREADR ? __q->q_other : __q
.fi
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
function call is inefficient, particularly as this function is called often
and regularly.

.BR SAMESTR (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR WR ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR WR ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.[
suxspg
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7spg
.]
.IR LiS ,
.[
lis
.]
permit both a read or write queue pointer to be passed
as the
.I q
argument to
.BR WR ().
If a write queue pointer is passed to
.BR WR (),
then the passed in write queue pointer is returned.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
.[
uxpspg
.]
permit only a read queue to be passed as the
.I q
argument to
.BR WR ().
Passing a write queue to
.BR WR ()
on these implementations can cause a kernel panic.
On these systems
.BR WR ()
is often defined as:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#define WR(__q) ((__q)+1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.IP \(em
.BR WR ()
is implemented on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
as both an
.B extern inline
function as well as a macro.
It accepts either read or write queue pointer and returns the passed in write
queue pointer when called with a write queue.
.I WR(q) == WR(WR(q))
and
.I WR(RD(q)) == (RD(q) + 1)
are invariantly true.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#undef WR
#define WR(__q) ((__q)+1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.sp
is a valid alternative implementation if the
.I STREAMS
programmer wishes the more restrictive
.BR WR ()
behavior.
.IP \(em
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not
call
.BR WR ()
with a queue other than the read queue;
nor
rely upon
.BR WR ()
being defined as a macro or a function.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
