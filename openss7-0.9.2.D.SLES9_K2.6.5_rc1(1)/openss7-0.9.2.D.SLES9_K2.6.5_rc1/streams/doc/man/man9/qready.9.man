.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int qready(void);"
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
None.

.SH INTERFACE

.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qready ()
tests if there is scheduled work for the
.I STREAMS
scheduler on the current CPU.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
uses
.BR qready ()
to see if
.BR runqueues (9)
should be called before returning from a system call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qready ()
returns true
.RB ( 1 )
if there is work to be performed by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler on the current CPU; false
.RB ( 0 ),
otherwise.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qready ()
always succeeds and returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qready ()
must be invoked in process context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qready ()
is processor-specific and inherently MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qready ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
driver or module writer.
.BR qready ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.BR qready ()
is highly implementation dependent in function and prototype.  Use of this
function by a driver or module will guarantee that it is not portable even between
releases of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.IP ""
.BR qready ()
is an internal function that will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.IP \(em
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
do not export this function.
