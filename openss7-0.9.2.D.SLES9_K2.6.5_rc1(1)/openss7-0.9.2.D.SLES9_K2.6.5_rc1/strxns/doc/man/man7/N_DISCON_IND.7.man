.SH NAME
.B N_DISCON_IND, N_discon_ind_t
\- disconnect indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
blocks.
The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_DISCON_IND */
    ulong DISCON_orig;          /* originator */
    ulong DISCON_reason;        /* reason */
    ulong RES_length;           /* responding address length */
    ulong RES_offset;           /* responding address offset */
    ulong SEQ_number;           /* sequence number */
} N_discon_ind_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This network-provider originated primitive indicates to the NS user that
either a request for connection has been denied or an existing connection has
been disconnected.
.PP
The value of the NS user data parameter is identical to the value in
the corresponding
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive.  The NS user data parameter is present only if the originator
parameter indicates that the release was initiated by the NS user.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I DISCON_orig
Indicates the source of the NC release.

.TP
.I DISCON_reason
Gives information about the cause of the release.

.TP
.I RES_length
Indicates the length of the address of the responding address parameter.  The
responding address parameter is an optional parameter, and is present in the
primitive only in the case where the primitive is used to indicate rejection
of an NC establishment attempt by an NS user.  When not present, the value of
this parameter is zero.  When present, the value of the disconnect address
parameter is identical to that supplied with the corresponding
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
primitive.

.TP
.I RES_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the network address begins.

.TP
.I SEQ_number
When its value is non-zero, it identifies the sequence number associated with
the
.BR N_CONN_IND (7)
that is being aborted.
.RS
.PP
The value of this parameter must be zero when:
.IP "a." 5
indicating the rejection of a previously issued N_CONN_REQ primitive; or
.IP b.
indicating the release of a NC that is already successfully established.  When
this field is non-zero and its value is the same as the sequence number
assigned to an unacknowledged
.BR N_CONN_IND (7),
it indicates that the NS provider is canceling the unacknowledged
.BR N_CONN_IND (7).
.SH STATE
The valid states are
.BR NS_WCON_CREQ ,
.BR NS_WRES_CIND ,
.BR NS_DATA_XFER ,
.BR NS_WCON_RREQ ,
and
.BR NS_WRES_RIND .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state is
.B NS_IDLE
(except when number of outstanding connect indications is greater than 1, in
which case the resulting state is
.BR NS_WRES_CIND ).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR N_CONN_IND (7),
.BR N_CONN_IND (7),
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
