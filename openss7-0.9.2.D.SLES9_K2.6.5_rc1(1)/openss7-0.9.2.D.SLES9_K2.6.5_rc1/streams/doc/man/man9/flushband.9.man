.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void flushband(queue_t *" q ", unsigned char " band ", int " flag ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to flush.
.PD 0
.TP
.I band
the band to flush within the queue.
.TP
.I flag
how to flush the band within the queue.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is used to flush messages from a message queue band.
It is typically called in a
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
handling routine to flush the requested messages from a queue band.
.PP
If
.I band
is zero (0),
.BR flushband ()
will flush only normal and high priority messages.
.PP
.I flag
can be one of the following:
.TP \w'\ FLUSHDATA\ 'u
.B FLUSHDATA
Flush only data messages; do not flush the control messages from the queue band.
.PD 0
.TP
.B FLUSHALL
Flush all the messages from queue band: both data messages and control
messages.
.PD
.PP
If
.I flag
is other than
.BR FLUSHDATA " or " FLUSHALL
.BR flushband ()
will perform
.BR FLUSHALL .
.PP
If
.B QB_WANTW
is set for the band and the flush causes the band's count to fall below the low water mark, or if
the band's count is reduced to zero, the nearest feeding queue with a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure or that is a
stream head or stream end (including a multiplexing driver) will be enabled.  That is, back-enabling
will be performed.  The
.B QB_FULL
and
.B QB_WANTW
flags will also be cleared.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR flushband ()
flushes the band and then returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR flushband ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR flushband ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is MP-safe when called from any context; however, the caller is responsibility for the validity of
the passed in
.I q
pointer across the call.
.PP
The validity of either queue in the pair, and either
.I q_next
pointer for a queue in the pair, for the queue pointer passed to a module
procedure, callout or synchronous callback functions, is guaranteed by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
Any queue pointer in the pair passed as an argument to an asynchronous callback
function are also valid, providing the driver or module observes the rules for
cancellation of asynchronous callbacks on close.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
also provides that a queue pointer in the pair within whose procedures an
asynchronous callback was invoked, and either
.I q_next
pointer, are also valid in an asynchronous callback.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is a widely supported
.I STREAMS
function.
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules may use
.BR flushband ();
however, portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules
will not call
.BR flushband ()
with a band of zero (0).
See
.RI \(lq COMPATIBILITY \(rq,
below.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR flushband ()
performs fast flushes by linking all band messages into the per-thread free
messages list.  These messages will then later be broken into individual
message blocks and freed to the per-thread free list and finally to the
.B mdbblock
memory cache at the end of any queue run.  A new queue service run will be
scheduled if one is not already running.
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is well optimized to handle the initial stage of
.B FLUSHALL
flushes in constant time.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is normally used within the
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
handling procedures for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module as follows:
.PP

Note in the example that the band is checked for band zero (0) before calling
.BR flushband ().
If the band is zero (0), then
.BR flushq (9)
is call instead.  This is consistent with portability recommendations listed under

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR flushband ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR flushband ()
moves messages from the queue to the per-CPU free chains list.  Freeing blocks
on the free chains list will be deferred to the next
.BR runqueues (9)
pass.  The next
.BR runqueues (9)
pass frees message blocks from the flush to the per-CPU free blocks list for
use by
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures in the pass.
.BR runqueues (9)
runs at normal soft interrupt priority.
.I LiS
removes all messages from the queue and then rebuilds the queue one
message at a time while freeing those to be flushed.  This is a rather
inefficient way to do things, and with
.I LiS
running at higher priority than
soft interrupts, bottom halves and timeouts, all these are locked out until
the flush is complete.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.BR flushband ()
should have far less of an impact on system latency and performance as that of
.IR LiS .
.IP ""
Performing
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
instead of
.IR LiS .
.IP \(em
.BR flushband ()
holds the queue write lock while removing selected messages or unlinking
entire bands.  Order is preserved across concurrent attempts to perform
.BR putq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR appq (9),
.BR rmvq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
functions.
.I LiS
empties the queue and unlocks the queue and then goes about adding
messages back onto the queue that need to remain using normal utility
functions.  This means that order is not necessarily preserved (even for messages
that were on the queue) with concurrent calls to
.BR putq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR appq (9),
.BR rmvq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
functions.
Also, queue enabling and back-enabling will not necessary be performed
correctly.
There doesn't seem to be any excuse for the
.I LiS
approach, removing messages
from the queue,
.BR rmvq (9),
is no more difficult than inserting them,
.BR insq (9).
