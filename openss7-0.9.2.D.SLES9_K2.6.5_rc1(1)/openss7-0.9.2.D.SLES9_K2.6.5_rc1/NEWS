  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream

  All RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian
  release numbers will be _0.  If you wish to apply patches and
  relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply a
  suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian
  release number _1 reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
  source in the .dsc file.

  Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
  and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
  distribution support.

* Initial release openss7-0.9.2-1
