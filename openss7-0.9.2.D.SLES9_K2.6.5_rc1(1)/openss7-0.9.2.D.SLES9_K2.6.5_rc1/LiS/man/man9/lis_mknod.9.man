.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int lis_mknod(const char *" pathname ", mode_t " mode ", dev_t " dev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I pathname
the pathname in the filesystem to make.
.TP
.I mode
the mode of the character special device file to make.
.TP
.I dev
the device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR mknod ()
is an
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
wrapper function to the system call
.BR mknod (2)
that can be called from the kernel.
.PP
The purpose of this kernel function call is to permit
.I STREAMS
kernel modules to create their own character special devices.  This allows the
.I STREAMS
device driver to allocate a character device major number at kernel module
initialization, see
.BR lis_register_strdev (9),
and create the necessary character special file entires in
.B /dev
after the major number has been allocated.  This avoids fixed allocation of
character device major numbers within the
.B Linux
kernel.
.PP
.BR mknod ()
takes the same arguments as
.BR mknod (2).
.PP
.I pathname
is a string which describes the path to the file.
.PP
.I mode
is the bitwise OR combination of the file type and permissions.  The file type
is one of the following:
.TP 10
.B S_IFREG
Normal file to be created empty.
.PD 0
.TP
.B S_IFCHR
Character special file.
.TP
.B S_IFBLK
Block special file.
.TP
.B S_IFIFO
FIFO named pipe.
.TP
.B S_IFSOCK
Socket.
.PD
.PP
The permissions is the normal combination of the file permissions and the
caller's
permissions:
.BR "" ( "mode & ~umask" ).
.PP
.I dev
is used only if the file type in
.I mode
is either
.BR S_IFCHR " or " S_IFBLK ;
where it specifies the combination of device major and device minor numbers.
For other file types
.I dev
is ignored.
.PP
For additional information, see
.BR mknod (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, the requested file is created and
.BR mknod ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure, no file is created and
.BR mknod ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR mknod ()
fails, it returns a negative error number that can contain any of the errors
listed under
.BR mknod (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mknod ()
must be called from user (process) context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mknod ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mknod ()
is implemented by changing the data segment to the kernel data segment and
calling
.BR mount (2).
This means that the
.BR uid " and " euid
of the caller is not changed.
This makes this function rather useless if the process invoking it is not the
kernel module loading daemon, or other process running with real root
permission, and a potential security breach otherwise.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR mknod (2),
.BR lis_mount (9),
.BR lis_umount2 (9),
.BR lis_unlink (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Under GCOM releases of
.IR LiS ,
.BR mknod ()
will not function and will panic the kernel on architectures that do not have a simple call
interface for system calls (e.g. parisc).
.PP
Previous and current OpenSS7 releases of
.I LiS
do not have this problem.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mknod ()
is compatible with
.BR mknod (2).
