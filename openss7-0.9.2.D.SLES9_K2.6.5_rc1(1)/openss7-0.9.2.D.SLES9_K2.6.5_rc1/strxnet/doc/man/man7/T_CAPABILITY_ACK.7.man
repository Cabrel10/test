.SH NAME
.B T_CAPABILITY_ACK
\- protocol capability acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of an
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message containing a
.B struct T_capability_ack
which contains (at least) the following members:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_capability_ack {
    t_scalar_t         PRIM_type;    /* always T_CAPABILITY_ACK  */
                                     /* must be the first field! */
    t_uscalar_t        CAP_bits1;    /* capability bits #1       */
    struct T_info_ack  INFO_ack;     /* info acknowledgement     */
    t_uscalar_t        ACCEPTOR_id;  /* accepting queue id       */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive is the response to a
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ
and informs the transport
user of various provider information and feature capabilities as encoded in
the field
.I CAP_bits1 .
The provider must only set those bits which it supports
and must leave as zero any bits not supported.
.SH PARAMETERS
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
This indicates the primitive type and is always
.BR T_CAPABILITY_ACK .
This field
must be strictly the first field to allow receivers to determine the message
type.
.TP
.I CAP_bits1
This is a 32-bit integer with zero or more of the following bits set, all
other bits must be zero:
.RS
.TP
.B TC1_INFO
This bit indicates that the
.I INFO_ack
field contains the information which
would have been returned in a
.B T_INFO_ACK
message at the same time.
.TP
.B TC1_ACCEPTOR_ID
This bit indicates that the
.I ACCEPTOR_id
field contains a unique identifier of
this connection which is suitable for use in the
.I ACCEPTOR_id
field of the
.B T_CONN_RES
message.
.TP
.B Extensibility
In addition the following bit is reserved for future use:
.B TC1_CAP_BITS2
.RE
.TP
.I INFO_ack
This field is a sub-structure which contains an entire
.B T_INFO_ACK
message so
that
.B T_CAPABILITY_ACK
can function as a replacement for that message.  The
contents are only valid if the
.B TC1_INFO
bit is set in
.IR CAP_bits1 .
.TP
.I ACCEPTOR_id
This field parallels the field of the same name in the
.BR T_CONN_RES
message and,
if the
.B TC1_ACCEPTOR_ID
bit is set in
.IR CAP_bits1 ,
supplies a suitable value for
use in the
.BR T_CONN_RES
message.
.SH RULES
If the
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ
was an
.B M_PCPROTO
then this message must also be sent
as an
.BR M_PCPROTO .
Similarly if the
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ
was an
.B M_PROTO
then this
message must also be sent as an
.BR M_PROTO .
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ (7).

The Transport Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
