.HP
.BI "int qclose(queue_t *" q ", int " flag ", cred_t *" credp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
is a pointer to the driver or module's read queue.
.TP
.I flag
is a close flag that contains a bitwise or of one or more of the following
flags:
.RS
.TP \w'FNDELAY\(em'u
.B FREAD
the \fISTREAMS\fP special file was opened for read.
.PD 0
.TP
.B FWRITE
the \fISTREAMS\fP special file was opened for write.
.TP
.B FEXCL
the \fISTREAMS\fP special file was opened for exclusive access.
.TP
.B FNDELAY
the \fISTREAMS\fP special file was opened for non-blocking operation.
.PD
.PP
The close flags are the same as the flags used to open the driver or module by
the closing user.
.RE
.TP
.I credp
is a pointer to a credentials structure indicating the credentials of the
process invoking the close, structured as follows:

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qclose ()
closes a
.I STREAMS
driver or module by calling the queue's
.I q->q_info->qi_close
procedure (if it exists).
.BR qclose ()
is invoked on the last close of a
.I STREAMS
character special file.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qclose ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that is not intended to be called
directly by the driver or module writer.  See
.BR close (2s)
and
.BR I_POP (7)
for indirect methods of invoking this function.  See
.IR qi_qclose (9)
for design guidelines for writing driver or module close routines.
This function is exported for
use by clone drivers and stream heads.  See
.BR register_inode (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qclose ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR qclose ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qclose ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.PP
In addition, any error returned by the module's
.I q->q_info->qi_close
function can be returned by
.BR qclose ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qclose ()
should only be called from user context or from within a
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qclose ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qclose ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.BR qclose ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following is an example of a module
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure (see
.IR qi_qclose (9)
for more detailed examples):
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
 1  int
 2  xxx_close(queue_t *q, int flag, cred_t *crp)
 3  {
 4      (void) flag;
 5      (void) crp;
 6      xxx_free_priv(q);
 7      MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
 8      return (0);
