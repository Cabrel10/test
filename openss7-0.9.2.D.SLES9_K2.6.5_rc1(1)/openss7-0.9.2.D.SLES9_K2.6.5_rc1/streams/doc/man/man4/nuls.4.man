.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <stropts.h>
.HP 12
.BI "int " fd " = open(" /dev/nuls ", " oflag );
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
is a file descriptor for a null stream opened using the
.BR open (2s)
system call on one of the following devices:
.TP
.RB \*(lq /dev/nuls \*(rq
This device is accessible to all users.
.PP
The
.B nuls
device is characterized by the following behaviour:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
All data written to  the
.B nuls
device with
.BR write (2s),
.BR writev (2s),
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
is discarded.
.IP \(em
All attempts to read the
.B nuls
device with
.BR read (2s),
.BR readv (2s),
.BR getmsg (2)
or
.BR getpmsg (2s)
will return zero length data.
.PP
In contrast to the Linux
.B /dev/null
and
.B /dev/zero
(see
.BR null (4),
.BR zero (4)),
.B nuls
is a
.B STREAMS
null device with the following additional characteristics:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.I STREAMS
modules can be pushed and popped from the device.
.IP \(em
The device response to all
.I STREAMS
I/O controls described in
.BR streamio (7).
.IP \(em
The device can be linked under a multiplexing driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B nuls
does not support any I/O controls of its own and all I/O controls delivered to
the driver will return an
.IR errno (3)
of
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ].
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B nuls
device can be opened when no other suitable device exists and modules may be
pushed on the
.B nuls
device.
.PP
Pushing a
.I STREAMS
module that responds to administrative I/O controls on the
.B nuls
device is a method of providing administrative drivers without consuming major device
numbers.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B nuls
device is used on systems that provide the older
.IR "SVR 3"
.[
svr3
.]
style
.B /dev/null
or
.BR /dev/zero .
On those systems, the
.B /dev/null
and
.B /dev/zero
devices are not
.I STREAMS
based and will not respond to
.I STREAMS
I/O controls.
.PP
The
.B nuls
device is used with the
.BR sc (4)
module as on
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
systems in support of the
.BR autopush (8),
.BR scls (8),
.BR strinfo (8),
.BR strload (8),
and
.BR strsetup (8)
commands.
.PP
Under
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
the
.B nuls
device is also used with the
.BR sockmod (4)
module in support of
.BR libsocket ,
and by
.BR libstreams ,
as an anonymous stream for non-file-descriptor related system call emulation
for
.BR fdetach (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B nuls
is implemented as a regular
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver.
.\"
.\"

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B nuls
device is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B /dev/nuls
can be used instead of
.B /dev/null
or
.B /dev/zero
for any purpose for which those devices are used.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
The
.B nuls
device first appeared in
.I SVR 4.2
.[

implementations for
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg.
