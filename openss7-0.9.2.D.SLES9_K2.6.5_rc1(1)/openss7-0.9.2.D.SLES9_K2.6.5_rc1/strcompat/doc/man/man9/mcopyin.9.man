.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'private\ \ 'u
.I mp
a pointer to the

or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block that was passed into the write-side put or service procedure from which
.BR mcopyin ()
is being called.
.TP

private data that the

.BR copyreq (9)
structure.
.TP
.I size
the number of bytes to copy in from the user address.
.TP
.I uaddr
a reference to the user address from which to copy data.  When performing a copy in operation on the
initial
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
of a
.I TRANSPARENT
.BR ioctl (2),
this argument must be
.BR NULL ;
in which case, the user address will be acquired from the passed in
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
helper function that is used to generate a properly formed
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message from a
.I TRANSPARENT
or
.RI non- TRANSPARENT
.RB ( I_STR )
.BR ioctl (2)
received as a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
.PP
The passed in
.I mp
argument is a pointer to a
.I TRANSPARENT
or
.I I_STR
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message or a pointer to a
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.  This message block should not be manipulated in any way by the caller and should be used
as passed to the
.I STREAMS
module or driver's write-side put or service procedure.
.PP
The passed in
.I private
argument is a pointer to a private datastructure to be assigned to the
.I cp_private
member of the
.BR copyreq (9)
structure that becomes the 
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message.
.PP
The
.I size
argument is the number of bytes to copy in.
.PP
The
.I uaddr
argument is the user-space address from which to copy the memory.  For use with
.I TRANSPARENT
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
messages, the
.I uaddr
argument is ignored and should be specified as
.B NULL
to indicate that the user-space address is to be retrieved from the message block attached to the
initial
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
is used to generate a properly formed
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message upstream from a module or drivers
write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
returns
.BR void .
Upon return, the passed in message block,
.IR mp ,
is adjusted to a properly formed
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message for the passed in arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
always succeeds; however, if
.BR mcopyin ()
is passed invalid pointers or arguments, kernel instability or a panic may result.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
should be called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
message.  This is normally the case when the message pointer is that passed to the write-side put or
service procedure of the
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mcopyin ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mcopyin ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Direct manipulation of the necessary structures using standard
.I STREAMS
utility functions should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mcopyin ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mcopyin ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mcopyin ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
