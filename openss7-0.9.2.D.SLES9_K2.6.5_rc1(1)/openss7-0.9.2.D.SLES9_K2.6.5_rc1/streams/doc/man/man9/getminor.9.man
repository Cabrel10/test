.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getmajor (9),
.BR getminor (9)
and
.BR makedevice (9)
are the device handling functions defined in
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
that are normally used by
.I STREAMS
device drivers in the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure.
.PP
.BR getminor ()
gets the internal (extended) device minor number associated with the external
.BR dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR getminor ()
is the normal architecture independent function call providing newer internal
and extended device numbering replacing older
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
behaviour using a function of the same name.
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is an architecture independent function that obtains the internal (extended)
minor device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.BR geteminor (9),
on the other hand, will return the external (real) minor device number
associated with the device
.IR dev .
.BR minor (9)
was the
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for this function.
.BR minor (3)
also exists as a user subroutine in
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .
.PP
.BR getminor ()
supports the concept of extended device numbering.  Under extended device
numbering, a device has a single internal (base) major device number and an
internal (extended) range of minor device numbers (exceeding 0 to 255).  Real
device number consist of a number of major device numbers visible to user
applications, and a range of minor device numbers associated with each major
device limited by the architecture (0 to 255 on
.BR "Linux 2.4" ).
.PP
Following is an example contrasting the mapping of external major and minor
device numbers to internal base major and extended minor device numbers:

.TE
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is compatible with all device numbering schemes provided by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
For additional information on device numbering, see section
.RI \(lq "Device Numbering" \(rq,
in
.BR dev_t (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is used by drivers and modules that do not required knowledge of external
major device numbers and that wish to use a simplified approach to assignment
of minor device numbers for
.BR clone (4)
operations.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR getminor ()
always returns the minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR getminor ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR getminor ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Depending on the architecture, the internal extended minor device number may
or may not be equal to one of the external (real) minor device numbers
assigned to the driver.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers should neither rely upon the specific value returned by
.BR getminor (),
nor should it hard code the range of minor device numbers available to the
major device number returned by
.BR getmajor (9).
.PP
.B minor_t
is
.BR "unsigned short" .
.PP
The current maximum range of extended minor device numbers is the range
of
.B minor_t
which is
.B unsigned short
or a range from 0 to 65535.
.PP
Although the extended minor device range is currently from 0 to 65535, only
the first 1024 minor device numbers can be represented as external (real)
device numbers.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR getminor ()
extracts the internal (base) major device number from
.I dev
using
.BR getmajor (9)
and the external (real) major and minor device numbers from
.I dev
using
.BR getemajor (9)
and
.BR geteminor (9).
It then uses
.BR itoeminor (9)
using the internal (base) major device number
return by
.BR getmajor (9)
to establish which ordinal belongs to the external major device number
returned by
.BR getemajor (9)
and adds an offset of 256 for each ordinal that the external major device
number is offset from the external base major device number.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[

including

.IR LiS ,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR Solaris \(rg
provides a somewhat different mechanism.  See
.BR ddi_driver_major (9),
.BR ddi_getiminor (9),
.BR ddi_create_minor_node (9)
and
.BR ddi_remove_minor_node (9).
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare "\(rg DDI8"
provides a different mechanism with registered driver resources and channel
numbers.
.IP \(em
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
does not support extended device numbering, and
.BR getminor ()
on
.I LiS
reduces to
.BR geteminor (9).
.I LiS
version 2.17
is supposed to have some enhancements in this regard.
.IP \(em
.BR getminor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4.2
for the purpose of porting drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because the
.B dev_t
structure for
.B Linux
differs from that of other implementations,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR getminor ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR getminor ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices is not supported.
