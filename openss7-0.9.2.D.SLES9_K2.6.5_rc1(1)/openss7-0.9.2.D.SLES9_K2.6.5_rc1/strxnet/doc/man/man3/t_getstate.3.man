.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_getstate(int " fd );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint for which to return the transport endpoint state.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_getstate ()
retrieve the state of the tranport interface associated with
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
is the local transport endpoint whose interface state is to be retrieved.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_getstate ()
returns a positive integer reflecting the transport interface state of
.I fd .
The state value returned can be one of the following:
.TP
.B T_UNINIT
the transport interface is in the uninitialized state.
.TP
.B T_UNBND
the transport interface is in the unbound state.
.TP
.B T_IDLE
the transport interface is in the idle state.
.TP
.B T_OUTCON
the transport interface is in the outgoing connection establishment state.
.TP
.B T_INCON
the transport interface is in the incoming connection establishment state.
.TP
.B T_DATAXFER
the transport interface is in the data transfer state.
.TP
.B T_OUTREL
the transport interface is in the outgoing connection release state.
.TP
.B T_INREL
the transport interface is in the incoming connection release state.

Upon failure,
.BR t_getstate ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"

.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_getstate ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSTATECHNG ]
The interface is in a transient state.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
