.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B connld
is a
.I STREAMS
module that can be pushed over a
.IR STREAMS -based
bi-drectional software pipe (see
.BR spx (4))
to provide automatic generation of new
.IR STREAMS -based
bi-drectional software pipes between a client and server process.
.PP
When
.BR open (2s)
is called on the end of a pipe upon which
.B connld
has been pushed (see
.BR streamio (7))
a new software pipe is created.  The file descriptor for the far end of the
newly created pipe is sent to the other end of the existing pipe in the same
fashion as an
.I I_SENDFD
IO control (see
.BR streamio (7))
and can be received at the other end of the existing pipe with
.IR I_RECVFD .
The file descriptor returned by the
.BR open (2s)
call will be the near end of the newly created pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The normal usage of
.B connld
is as follows:
.IP (1) \w'(000)'u
A server process creates a software pipe using
.BR pipe (2s)
or
.BR spx (4).
.IP (2)
The server process pushes the
.B connld
module on the client end of the pipe using the
.I I_PUSH
command of
.BR streamio (7).
.IP (3)
The server process names the client end of the pipe using
.BR fattach (3).
.IP (4)
The server process uses
.BR poll (2s)
to listen for received file descriptors on the server end of the pipe.
.IP (5)
When a client process performs an
.BR open (2s)
on the file to which the client end of the pipe has been named with
.BR fattach (3),
.B connld
creates a new pipe, sends the server side file descriptor to the server with
the
.I I_SENDFD
command of
.BR streamio (7)
and returns the file descriptor of the client end of the new pipe in return to
the
.BR open (2s)
call.
.IP (6)
The server receives the file descriptor with the
.I I_RECVFD
command of
.BR streamio (7)
resulting in a unique per-client bi-directional
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe for each connecting client.
