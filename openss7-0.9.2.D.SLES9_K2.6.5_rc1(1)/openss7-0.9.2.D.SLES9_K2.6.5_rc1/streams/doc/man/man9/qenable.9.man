.SH NAME
.B qenable
\- schedules a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue service procedure
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void qenable(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to enable.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qenable ()
schedules the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of the queue pointed to by
.I q
to be run by
.BR runqueues (9).
If the queue pointed to by
.I q
has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable (9),
then
.BR qenable ()
will still succeed in enabling the queue.
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is normally called to invoke the execution of
.IR q 's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qenable ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qenable ()
fails, it fails silently.
.BR qenable ()
fails to enable the queue when the queue does not have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.  Otherwise,
.BR qenable ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
If the queue was not already enabled
.RI ( qi_srvp (9)
procedure already scheduled to run) on a different CPU,
.BR qenable ()
schedules the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of the queue,
.IR q ,
using
.BR scheduleq (9)
on the current CPU.  In this case, the queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure for the queue,
.IR q ,
will not execute until after
.BR qenable ()
returns and the function that called
.BR qenable ()
returns or encounters a preemption point.
However, if the queue is already scheduled by another processor  and
.BR qenable ()
was not called from a context synchronous with the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, another
processor may run the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure before
.BR qenable ()
returns.
.PP
Therefore,
.BR qenable ()
should be called with
.I STREAMS
synchronization in effect, or hold the necessary private locks across the
call to
.BR qenable (),
if it is ncessary to synchronize the call to
.BR qenable ()
with execution of the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qenable ()
has no effect if the queue has already been enabled due to internal
.I STREAMS
scheduler actions, or a previous call to
.BR qenable ()
that has not yet completed service.
.PP
Enabling a queue from within its own
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure will not reschedule the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qenable ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qenable ()
only schedules the queue for later service.
.BR qenable ()
schedules a queue regardless of whether the
.B QNOENB
flag is set, or whether
.BR noenable (9)
has been called for the queue,
For a version of this function that considers the
.B QNOENB
flag, see
.BR enableq (9).
Even as far back as
.IR "SVR 3.1" ,
.[
svr3spg
.]
the
.BR noenable (9),
.BR enableok (9)
and
.BR canenable (9)
functions affecting the
.B QNOENB
flag have only affected
.BR putq (9)
scheduling the queue,
.IR q .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will expect that
.BR qenable ()
will enable a queue regardless of the state of the
.B QNOENB
flag and the calling of
.BR noenable (9).
.IP \(em
.BR qenable ()
is not bug for bug compatible with
.IR LiS .
.IP ""
Under older versions of
.IR LiS ,
.BR qenable ()
will not enable a queue previously disabled with
.BR enableok ()
or
.BR qprocsoff ().
This is an
.I LiS
bug.
Under current versions of
.IR LiS ,
this is not the case, but current versions of
.I LiS
have their own bugs: for example,
.BR qenable ()
will not enable a queue that is closing (i.e. had the
.B QCLOSING
flag set), which is before driver and module
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures get called.

.IP ""
Portable

but will use

was invoked on the queue previously.

Older versions of

source code,
on the other hand, shows that no queue will be enabled while the
.BR QNOENB ", "  QPROCSOFF " or " QCLOSING
flags are set.
This is an
.I LiS
bug.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not rely on
.BR qenable ()
to enable a stream that is disabled previously with
.BR noenable (9);
instead, it will reenable the stream with
.BR enableok (9)
before calling
.BR qenable ().
