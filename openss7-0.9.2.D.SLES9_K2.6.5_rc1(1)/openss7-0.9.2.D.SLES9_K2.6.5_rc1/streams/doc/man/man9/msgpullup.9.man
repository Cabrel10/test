.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "mblk_t msgpullup(mblk_t *" mp ", int " len ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
the message to pull up.
.PD 0
.TP
.I len
the number of bytes to pull up.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
will copy and align
.I len
bytes from the message pointed to by
.I mp
into a new message, if possible, whose pointer is returned.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains more bytes than specified by
.IR len ,
.BR msgpullup ()
will copy the remaining bytes onto the end of the new message.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains less than
.I len
bytes,
.BR msgpullup ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL .
If
.I len
is specified as -1,
all the bytes of the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
will be concatenated, copied and aligned into the new message.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR msgpullup ()
returns a pointer to the new message.
Upon failure,
.BR msgpullup ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the number of bytes in the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
is less than
.IR len ;
and when allocation for the new message fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call outs, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is MP-safe.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure exclusive access to
the passed in message.
See
.BR mp-streams (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is a
.I SVR 4.0 MP DDI/DKI
replacement for
.BR pullupmsg (9).
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.BR msgpullup ()
in place of
.BR pullupmsg (9).

.SH BUGS

.BR msgpullup ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4.0 MP
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
do not document this function
.[
aixdoc
.]
.[
osfdoc
.]
.[
uxpdoc
.]
(nor a bunch of other
.I SVR 4.0 MP STREAMS
functions for that matter).
.IP \(em
The
.I LiS
implementation of
.BR msgpullup ()
allocates blocks for the new message before it checks to see whether the number of bytes in the
passed in message is less than
.IR len.
This is inefficient if it is normally the case that the passed in message has less bytes than
.IR len .
.IP ""
Performance conscious
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
instead of
.IR LiS .
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
states that
.BR msgpullup ()
is a \*(lq\)DKI-compliant replacement for the older
.BR pullupmsg (9)
routine,\*(rq that is \*(lq\)not included in the DKI and will be removed form the system in a future
release\*(rq and that users \*(lq\)are strongly encouraged to use
.BR msgpullup ()
instead of
.BR pullupmsg (9).\*(rq
.[
soldoc
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation indicates that
.IR "SCO OpenServer" \(rg
is stuck with
.BR pullupmsg (9).
.[
uw7doc
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation
indicates that
.BR pullupmsg (9)
was only applicable to
.IR "SVR 4.0" ,
.IR "SVR 4.1 ES" ,
and
.IR "SVR 4.2" .
That is, no multiprocessor (MP) releases support
.BR pullupmsg (9).
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation also indicates that use of
.BR pullupmsg (9)
can panic a multiprocessor (MP)
.IR UnixWare \(rg " 7
system, and yet is suitable for a multiprocessor (MP)
.IR "SCO OpenServer" \(rg
system.
.[
uw7doc
.]
So, although
.BR msgpullup ()
is recommended by
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
instead of
.BR pullupmsg (9),
.BR pullupmsg (9)
is by far the more popular interface and has the widest support.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules may use
.BR msgpullup (9)
instead of
.BR pullupmsg ().
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
supports both in an MP-safe way.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
indicates that the memory for data buffers returned by both
.BR pullupmsg (9)
and
.BR msgpullup ()
(through
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" )
are suitable for worst-case DMA and are phsysically contiguous.
.[
uw7doc
.]
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
also exhibits this behaviour.  Physical contiguous data buffers, aligned on a layer 1 cache boundary
and suitable for worst-case DMA are allocated by
.BR pullupmsg (9)
but not
.BR msgpullup ().
Physical contiguous data buffers, not necessarily aligned on a layer 1 cache boundary and not
necessarily suitable for worst-case DMA are allocated by
.BR msgpullup ().
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will no make any assumptions about the phsyical contiguity or suitability for
worst-case DMA of data buffers allocated via
.BR msgpullup ().
.\".IP \(em
.\"Symbol
.\".BR lis_msgpullup ()
.\"is provided for compatibility with
.\".IR LiS .
.\"See
.\".BR liscompat (9).
.IP \(em
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
documents
.[
suxspg
.]
.BR msgpullup ()
as failing under the same circumstances as
.BR pullupmsg (9)
with regard to the number of bytes of messages of the same type being pulled up.  That is, if
.I len
is not
.B -1
and
.I len
bytes of messages of the same type cannot be found,
.BR msgpullup ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not rely upon any expected behaviour in this corner case.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
