.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strerr
daemon receives error log messages from the
.I STREAMS
log driver
.RB ( log (4))
and writes these messages to standard output.
When run as a daemon,
.B strerr
appends these messages to a log file.
The error log files produced
reside in the directory
.BR /var/adm/streams " or " /var/log/streams ,
or a user-specified directory,
and are named
.BI error. mm-dd\fR,
where
.I mm
is the month and
.I dd
is the day of the messages contained in each log file.
.PP
By default,
.B strlogd
logs all
.I STREAMS
error messages from all drivers and modules.
.PP
Messages that appear in the error log are intended to report exceptional
conditions that require the attention of the person who administers your
system.  Those messages indicating the total failure of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module should have the
.B F
flag set.  Those messages requiring the immediate attention of the
administrator should have the
.B N
flag set, which causes the console logger to send the message to that person by
way of the
.BR mail (1)
command.  The priority level usually has no meaning in the error log, but does
have meaning if the message is also sent to the tracer process.
.PP
Once initiated, the
.B strerr
daemon continues to execute until terminated by the user.  Usually, the
.B strerr
daemon is executed asynchronously.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--admin\fR \fImailuid\fR
Specifies the mail user or alias to which to send all mail messages.  Mail is
sent to
.RB \(lq root \(rq
by default.
.TP
\fB-d\fR, \fB--directory\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Specifies a directory to contain the messages.  Default is to search for
.RB \(lq /var/adm/streams \(rq
and then
.RB \(lq /var/log/streams .\(rq
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--nodaemon\fR
Do not daemonize, run in the foreground, print output to
.I stdout
and error logs to
.IR stderr .
This option is most usefull for debugging
.BR strerr .
.TP
\fB-b\fR, \fB--basename\fR \fIbasename\fR
Specify the log file basename.  Default is
.RB \(lq error \(rq .
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--outfile\fR \fIoutfile\fR
Specifiy the log file output name.
When run as a daemon, the default is
.RI \(lq basename . mm-dd \(rq,
where
.I mm-dd
is the current month and day of month.
When run in the foreground, the default is ignored and all output is to
.IR stdout .
When specified, standard output is redirected to the specified file regardless of whether
.B strerr
is being run in the foreground or as a daemon.
.TP
\fB-e\fR, \fB--errfile\fR \fIerrfile\fR
Specify the error file output name.
When run as a daemon, the default is
.RI \(lq /dev/null \(rq
and all errors are logged to
.BR syslogd (8).
When run in the foreground, the default is ignored and all errors are logged to
.IR stderr .
When specified, standard error is redirected to the specified file regardless of whether
.B strerr
is being run in the foreground or as a daemon.
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--pidfile\fR \fIpidfile\fR
Specify the pid file output name.  Default is
.RB \(lq /var/run/strerr.pid .\(rq
When run in the foreground, the default is ignored.
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--logdev\fR \fIlogdevice\fR
Specifies the log device.  Default is to search
.RB \(lq /dev/streams/strlog ,\(rq
.RB \(lq /dev/streams/log ,\(rq
.RB \(lq /dev/strlog \(rq
and
.RB \(lq /dev/log .\(rq
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Suppresses normal output.
This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 0 .
.TP
\fB-D\fR, \fB--debug\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increase or specify the debug output
.IR level .
When a debug
.I level
has been specified,
.B strerr
will log to
.IR stdout ,
prints debug messages to
.IR stderr ,
and will not place itself in the background.
This option may be repeated.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increase or specify the verbosity
.I level
of the output.  This option may be repeated.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strerr
displays usage information on
.I stdout
and exits.
No further processing of options or arguments is performed and no actions are taken.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strerr
displays version information on
.I stdout
and exits.
No further processing of options or arguments is performed and no actions are taken.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strerr
displays copying and copyright information on
.I stdout
and exits.
No further processing of options or arguments is performed and no actions are taken.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.B strerr
takes no non-option arguments.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
.I STREAMS
error log messages have the following format:
.HP
.RB < seq "> <" time "> <" ticks "> <" flags "> <" mid "> <" sid "> <" text >
.PP
Components are interpreted as follows:
.TP \w'<flags>\(em'u
.RB < seq >
Error sequence number.
.PD 0
.TP
.RB < time >
Time the message was sent expressed in hh:mm:ss.
.TP
.RB < ticks >
Time the message was sent expressed in machine ticks since last boot.
.TP
.RB < flags >
Any combination of the following three message indicators:
.RS
.IP \fBT\fP 3
The message has also sent to a tracing process.
.IP \fBF\fP
The message signalled a fatal error.
.IP \fBN\fP
The message has also been mailed to the system administrator.
.RE
.TP
.RB < mid >
Module identification number of the error message source.
.TP
.RB < sid >
Sub-identification number of the error message source.
.TP
.RB < text >
Formatted text of the error message.
.PD
.\"On multiprocessor systems,
.\".RB < text >
.\"is composed of two parts:
.\".RS
.\".IP \(bu
.\"the number of processors where the owner of the message has sent it.
.\".IP \(bu
.\"the formatted text itself.
.\".RE
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero
.RB ( 0 )
indicates that the command was successful; one
.RB ( 1 )
indicates that an error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two
.RB ( 2 )
indicates that the option or argument syntax was in error and a
diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .
.PP
The
.B --quiet
option suppresses the printing of diagnostic messages to
.IR stderr .
.\"
.\"
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
.B strerr
catches the
.B SIGHUP
signal
.RB "(see " signal (7)).
.TP
.B SIGHUP
When the
.B SIGHUP
signal is caught,
.B strerr
will close the current log file and open a new (or reopen the existing) log
file.  This is for use with
.BR logrotate (8).
.TP
.B SIGTERM
When the
.B SIGTERM
signal is caught,
.B strerr
flushes and closes all of its log files and then exits.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Only one
.B strerr
daemon or process at a time is permitted to open the
.I STREAMS
log driver as an error logger.
If a module or driver is generating a large number of error
messages, running the error logger causes a degradation in
.I STREAMS
performance.  If a large number of messages are generated in a short time, the
log driver may not be able to deliver some of the messages.  This situation is
indicated by gaps in the sequence numbering of the messages in the log files.
.PP
When run in the foreground,
.B strerr
runs until terminated by the caller.
.PP
Running
.B strerr
can impair
.I STREAMS
performance, particularly for those modules and drivers that are sending the
messages.
Also be aware that
.B strerr
may not be able to handle a large number of messages.  If drivers and modules
return messages to
.B strerr
too quickly, some may be lost.
.PP
Due to performance considerations, only one
.B strerr
command is permitted to open the
.I STREAMS
.B log
driver at a time.
Running the
.B strerr
command has the most impact on the timing of modules and drivers generating
the error messages that are sent to the
.B strerr
process.  If error messages are generated faster than the
.B strerr
process can handle them, some of the messages will be lost.  This last case
can be determined by examining the sequence numbers on the error messages
output.

option.
