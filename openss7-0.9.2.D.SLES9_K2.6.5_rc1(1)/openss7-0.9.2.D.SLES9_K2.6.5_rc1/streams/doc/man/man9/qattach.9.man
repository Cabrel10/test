.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is called when the
.B I_PUSH
command is issued to a
.IR STREAMS (4)
character special file.  See
.BR streamio (7)
for more information on
.BR I_PUSH .
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is responsible for allocating a queue pair with
.BR allocq (9),
linking the queues into the stream, and calling the module's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
When
.BR qattach ()
is called to attach (push) a module,
.I sflag
must be
.BR MODOPEN
and a queue pair must have already been allocated for the stream head and for
the driver.
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is also responsible for allocating a driver queue pair, attaching it to the
stream head and calling the driver's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure.
When
.BR qattach ()
is called to attach and open a driver,
.I sflag
must be either
.BR DRVOPEN " or " CLONEOPEN .
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is also used to allocate the stream head queue pair, attaching it to the stream
head and calling the stream head queue pair's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is not intended to be called by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.PP
.BR qattach ()
should only be called from the
.BR I_PUSH (7)
or
.BR qdetach (9)
procedure or a Stream head
.BR stropen (9)
open or
.BR strclose (9)
close procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qattach ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR qattach ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qattach ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENOMEM\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EIO ]
there is no queue associated with the stream
.IR sd .
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
could not allocate a queue pair with
.BR qalloc (9).
.PP
In addition, any error returned by the module's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
function can be returned by
.BR qattach ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qattach ()
should only be called from blockable user process context or from within a
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called by
the
.I STREAMS
driver or module writer.
.BR qattach ()
is not part of the
.I DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
and should not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.BR qattach ()
is highly implementation dependent in function and prototype.  Use of this
function by a driver or module will guarantee that it is not portable even between
releases of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qattach ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qattach ()
is compatible with descriptions of
