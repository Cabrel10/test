.SH NAME
.B getminor, lis_getminor
\- get the minor device number for a device.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/streams.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP 8
.BI "minor_t getminor(dev_t " dev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I dev
the device number from which to extract the minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getmajor (9),
.BR getminor (9)
and
.BR makedevice (9)
are the device handling functions defined in
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
that are normally used by
.I STREAMS
device drivers in the
.BR qopen ()
procedure.
.PP
.BR getminor ()
gets the internal (extended) device minor number associated with the external
.BR dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR getminor ()
is the normal architecture independent function call providing newer internal
and extended device numbering replacing older
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
behaviour using a function of the same name.
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is an architecture independent function that obtains the internal (extended)
minor device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.BR geteminor (),
on the other hand, will return the external (real) minor device number
associated with the device
.IR dev .
.BR minor ()
was the
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for this function.
.BR minor (3)
also exists as a user subroutine in
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is used by drivers and modules that do not required knowledge of external
major device numbers and that wish to use a simplified approach to assignment
of minor device numbers for
.BR clone (4)
operations.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR getminor ()
always returns the minor device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR getminor ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR getminor ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
In older versions of
.IR LiS ,
.BR getminor ()
simply invoked the kernel macro
.BR MINOR ().
Also, in older versions of
.IR LiS ,
.BR getmajor ()
returned
.BR "unsigned char" .
More recent versions of
.I LiS
use an internal representation for
.B dev_t
and have an internal function.
Also, more recent versions return
.BR major_t ,
which is
.BR "unsigned int" .
.PP
Depending on the architecture, the internal extended minor device number may
or may not be equal to one of the external (real) minor device numbers
assigned to the driver.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers should neither rely upon the specific value returned by
.BR getminor (),
nor should it hard code the range of minor device numbers available to the
major device number returned by
.BR getmajor (9).
.PP
.B minor_t
is
.BR "unsigned int" .
.PP
The current maximum range of extended minor device numbers is the range
of
.B minor_t
which is
.B unsigned int
or a range from 0 to
.BR MAXINT .
.PP
Although the extended minor device range is currently from
0 to
.BR MAXINT ,
only the first 2^10 minor device numbers can be represented as external (real)
device numbers on an older 16-bit device number Linux system; the first 2^22
device numbers can be represented as external (real) device numbers on newer
32-bit device number Linux systems.

.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR getminor (9),
.BR makedevice (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Under current versions of
.IR LiS ,
.BR getminor ()
will not accept an external
.B dev_t
device number and return a proper value.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getminor ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[
svr4
.]
including
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR LiS ,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR Solaris \(rg
provides a somewhat different mechanism.  See
.BR ddi_driver_major (),
.BR ddi_getiminor (),
.BR ddi_create_minor_node ()
and
.BR ddi_remove_minor_node ().
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare "\(rg DDI8"
provides a different mechanism with registered driver resources and channel
numbers.
.IP \(em
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
does not support extended device numbering, and
.BR getminor ()
on
.I LiS
reduces to
.BR geteminor ().
On current versions of
.IR LiS ,
.BR getminor ()
still does not support extended device numbering, however,
.BR getminor ()
will now only accept an internal device number argument.
.IP \(em
.BR getminor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4.2
for the purpose of porting drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because the
.B dev_t
structure for
.B Linux
differs from that of other implementations,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR getminor ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR getminor ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices is not supported.
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
