.SH ARGUMENTS

the queue from which to reply.

the message to reply with.

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qreply ()
replies, with the message pointed to by
.IR mp ,
to the read queue that is upstream from the specified write queue
pointed to by
.IR q ,
or the write queue downstream from the specified read queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is normally used within
.IR q 's
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure to reply to messages that have arrived on its write queue from
upstream, or its read queue from downstream.
.PP
It is the responsibility of the procedure calling
.BR qreply ()
with a normal message pointer to by
.I mp
to first call
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9)
for the queue to check for flow control.  If
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9)
fails for queue
.IR q ,
the procedure should not normally invoke
.BR qreply ()
with a low priority message for the flow controlled queue
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next .
.PP
.BR qreply ()
will wake up any processes waiting with
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9)
on the previous queue
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qreply ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qreply ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the
passed in message block.  The caller should remove all global references to
the passed in message block before calling
.BR qreply ().
.PP
.BR qreply ()
whould always be used in the MP environment in preference to
.BI put(OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next ", " mp )
because the later does not protect dereference of the
.I q_next
pointer.
.BI putnext(OTHERQ( q "), " mp )
would be an acceptable alternative.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BI qreply( q ", " mp )
has the same effect as
.BI putnext(OTHERQ( q "), " mp )).
Because
.BR qreply ()
invokes the
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure of the upstream or downstream queue, the same care
should be taken with
.BR qreply ()
as is taken with
.BR putnext (9).

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qreply ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qreply ()
could panic the kernel if passed a
.B NULL
or invalid queue or message pointer.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR qreply ()
fails silently and frees
.I mp
if
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.BI OTHERQ( q )
is
.BR NULL ;
.BI OTHERQ( q )
does not refer to a queue structure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
is
.BR NULL ;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
does not refer to a queue structure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next->q_info
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
does not have a
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure;
.BI OTHERQ( q ) ->q_next
has
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not pass

.BR qreply ()
protects dereference of the

offer the same protection.
