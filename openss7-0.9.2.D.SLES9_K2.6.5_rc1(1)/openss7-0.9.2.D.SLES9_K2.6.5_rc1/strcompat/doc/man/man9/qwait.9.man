.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the read queue of the queue pair for which to wait for a
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure to run.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qwait ()
is called within a module or driver's
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedure to await the arrival of a message at the queue pair indicated by the
read queue pointer,
.IR q .
.PP
.BR qwait_sig ()
is called in the same manner as
.BR qwait ();
however,
.BR qwait_sig ()
may be interrupted by a signal.
The value returned by
.BR qwait_sig ()
indicates whether the wait was terminated as a result of a message arriving at
the queue pair, or whether it was a result of interruption by a signal.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qwait ()
returns
.B void
once a
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure has been executed for the queue pair.
.PP
.BR qwait_sig ()
returns true (1) if a
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure has been executed for the queue pair; and returns false (0) if a
signal interrupted the wait.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qwait ()
or
.BR qwait_sig ()
can only be called from user context, or within the
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
procedures for the queue pair.
.BR qprocson (9)
must be executed before calling
.BR qwait ()
or
.BR qwait_sig ().
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
must be called before calling
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
should not be called for a stream or queue frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose these symbols.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.PP
Because
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
only allows one thread entry to the
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedures, invoking
.BR qwait ()
might indefinitely postpone non-exclusive open or close of the
.I STREAMS
file.
.BR qwait_sig ()
is a better choice for almost all circumstances.
The caller of
.BR qwait_sig ()
should exit the
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedure with the error
.RB [ EINTR ].

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
functions and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  See the more standardized
.BR SV_WAIT (9)
and
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9)
functions provided by
.IR "SVR 4 MP" .

.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR UXP/V \(rg
and
.IR LiS ,
do not provide this function.
.IP \(em
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
are provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR qwait ()
and
.BR qwait_sig ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR qwait ()
or
.BR qwait_sig ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
