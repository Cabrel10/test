.TH BIND 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B bind
\- bind a name to a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int bind(int " socket ", const struct sockaddr *" address ", socklen_t " address_len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR bind ()
function assigns an address to an unnamed socket.  Sockets
created with the
.BR socket (3)
function are initially unnamed; they are
identified only by their address family.
.PP
The function takes the following arguments:
.TP
.I socket
Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be bound.
.TP
.I address
Points to a sockaddr structure containing the address to be bound to the
socket.  The length and format of the address depend on the address family
of the socket.
.TP
.I address_len
Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address
argument.
.PP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges
to use the
.BR bind ()
function.
.SH NOTES
.PP
An application program can retrieve the assigned socket name with the
.BR getsockname (3)
function.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR bind ()
returns 0.  Otherwise, -1 is returned
and
.IR errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR bind ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EADDRINUSE ]
The specified address is already in use.
.TP
.RB [ EADDRNOTAVAIL ]
The specified address is not available from the local machine.
.TP
.RB [ EAFNOSUPPORT ]
The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of the
specified socket.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The address argument can not be accessed.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The socket is already bound to an address, and the protocol does not
support binding to a new address; or the socket has been shut down.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSOCK ]
The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The socket type of the specified socket does not support binding to an
address.
.PP
If the address family of the socket is
.BR AF_UNIX ,
then
.BR bind ()
will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
A component of the path prefix denies search permission, or the requested name
requires writing in a directory with a mode that denies write permission.
.TP
.RB [ EDESTADDRREQ "] or [" EISDIR ]
The address argument is a null pointer.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.RB [ ELOOP ]
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname in
address.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
A component of a pathname exceeded
.RI { NAME_MAX }
characters, or an entire
pathname exceeded
.RI { PATH_MAX }
characters.
.TP
.RB [ ENOENT ]
A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the pathname
is an empty string.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in address is not a
directory.
.TP
.RB [ EROFS ]
The name would reside on a read-only filesystem.
.PP
The
.BR bind ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
The specified address is protected and the current user does not have
permission to bind to it.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The address_len argument is not a valid length for the address family.
.TP
.RB [ EISCONN ]
The socket is already connected.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds
.IR { PATH_MAX }.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient resources were available to complete the call.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient STREAMS resources for the operation to complete.
