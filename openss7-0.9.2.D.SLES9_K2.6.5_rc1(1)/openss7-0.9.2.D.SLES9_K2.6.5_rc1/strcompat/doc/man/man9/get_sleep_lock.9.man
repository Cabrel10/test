.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _HPUX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/hpuxddi.h>
.HP
lock_t \fBget_sleep_lock\fR(caddr_t \fIevent\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I event
The event that will be subsequently passed to
.BR sleep (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
provides access to the global sleep lock that may be used by all threads
entering a wait queue that require mutual exclusion to avoid race conditions
when entering the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
returns a pointer to the
.B lock_t
global sleep spin lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
is MP-safe.  Safety of procedures using the global spin lock rely upon proper
use of the spin lock for mutual exclusion and avoidance of race conditions
when entering wait queues.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
simply returns a pointer to a global
.B lock_t
basic lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR sleep (9),
.BR qwait (9),
.BR qwait_sig (9),
.BR SV_WAIT (9),
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
is compatible with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
is an
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  The more common
.BR SV_WAIT (9)
and
.BR SV_WAIT_SIG (9)
functions should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
Under
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
may obtain a separate sleep lock for every
.I event
passed to it.  Under
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" ,
the
.I event
argument is ignored and a single global sleep lock is obtained.
.IP \(em
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR get_sleep_lock ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
