or

call when the Stream was created.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B I_GERROPT
.BR ioctl (2s)
command retrieves the error options for the Stream associated with
.IR fd .
.PP
The error options consist of one of the following flags:
.TP \w'\fBWERRNONPERSIST\fR\(em'u
.B RERRNORMAL
Read errors received in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message are persistent.  That is, the error is returned to every
.BR read (2s)
like system call until an
.B M_ERROR (9)
message with a
.B NOERROR
value in the read (or only) position is received.
.TP
.B RERRNONPERSIST
Read errors received in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message a non-persistent.  That is, the error is reported only once, to the first
.BR read (2s)
like system call and then is reset back to
.BR NOERROR .
.PP
logically OR'ed with one of the following flags:
.TP \w'\fBWERRNONPERSIST\fR\(em'u
.B WERRNORMAL
Write errors received in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message are persistent.  That is, the error is returned to every
.BR write (2s)
like system call until an
.B M_ERROR (9)
message with a
.B NOERROR
value in the write (or only) position is received.
.TP
.B WERRNONPERSIST
Write errors received in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message a non-persistent.  That is, the error is reported only once, to the first
.BR write (2s)
like system call and then is reset back to
.BR NOERROR .
.PP
Error options remain in effect until changed with the
.BR I_SERROPT (7)
command.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success, the
.B I_GERROPT
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns zero
.RB ( 0 )
or a positive integer.
Upon failure, the
.B I_GERROPT
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns
.B -1
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the
.B I_GERROPT
.BR ioctl (2s)
command fails, it returns
.B -1
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to one of the following errors:
.TP \w'[EWOULDBLOCK]\(em'u
.RB [ EFAULT ]
.I arg
points to an area that extends outside the caller's valid address space.
.PP
Note that the
.B I_GERROPT
command will not return an error if the Stream head has received an
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
or
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message.
.\"
.PP
In general, any
.BR ioctl (2s)
command can fail if:
.TP \w'[EWOULDBLOCK]\(em'u
.RB [ EFAULT ]
.IR arg ,
or a pointer member of a structure pointed to by
.IR arg ,
points to an address that is outside the caller's valid address space.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.IR fd ", " cmd ", " arg " or a member of " arg " or a member of a structure pointed to by " arg
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
.I fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSTR ]
.I fd
is not a
.I STREAMS
special file.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
.I fd
does not support the requested operation.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
.I fd
refers to Stream that is closing.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTTY ]
.I fd
does not refer to a
.I STREAMS
special file that accepts I/O controls.
.TP
.RB [ ENODEV ]
.I fd
refers to a
.I STREAMS
special file that does not support the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
(Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
all
.I STREAMS
special files support the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.)
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
.I fd
refers to Stream that has received a hangup, that is, an
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
message was received by the Stream head.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
the I/O control command cannot be performed by this particular sub-device.
.TP
.RB [ EPIPE ]
.I fd
refers to a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe and the other end of the pipe is closed.
.TP
.RB [ ESTRPIPE ]
.I fd
refers to a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe and a write operation was attempted with no
readers at the other end, or a read operation was attempted, the pipe is
empty, and there are no writers at the other end.
(This error is not normally returned to user level programs.)
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I fd
refers to a Stream that is linked under a multiplexing driver.  If a Stream is
linked under a multiplexing driver, all
.BR ioctl (2s)
commands other than
.B I_UNLINK
or
.B I_PUNLINK
will return
.RB [ EINVAL ].
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
a signal was received (or generated by the call) before the operation could begin.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
a signal was received before the operation could complete.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN "]
the file is set for asynchronous I/O and the operation would block.  (A
.I STREAMS
special file is set for asynchronous I/O when
.BR open (2s)
was called with the
.B O_NDELAY
or
.B O_NONBLOCK
flags, or one these flags were subsequently set with a call to
.BR fcntl (2).)
.TP
.RB [ EWOULDBLOCK ]
See
.RB [ EAGAIN ].
(For most architectures under
.BR Linux ,
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
and
.BR [ EWOULDBLOCK ]
have the same value.)
.TP
.RB [ ETIME ]
the operation timed out awaiting an acknowledgement or response (to the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message) from the module or driver.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
a message block could not be allocated during the operation and the operation
is not permitted to block.
Under some circumstances, an
.BR ioctl (2s)
command will block awaiting the availability of message blocks, regardless of the setting of
.BR O_NDELAY " or " O_NONBLOCK .
.PP
Any error delivered to the Stream head in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message can be returned in
.IR errno (3).
.PP
Where the command results in a call to a module or driver
.BR qopen "(9) or " qclose (9)
procedures, as is the case for
.BR I_PUSH (7),
.BR I_POP (7),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
or
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
an error number returned by the module or driver
.BR qopen "(9) or " qclose (9)
procedure can also be returned in
.IR errno (3).
.PP
Any error returned in an
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message from the module or driver in response to an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message issued for an
.BR I_STR (7),
.BR I_LINK (7),
or
.BR I_PLINK (7),
.BR ioctl (2s)
can be returned in
.IR errno (3).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.I STREAMS
.BR ioctl (2s)
calls are complex and there is much conflicting documentation in specific
areas of behaviour.  Not all bugs are bugs and not all features are features.
.PP
The

command is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
specific command provided to assist portability from
.IR Solaris \(rg
to

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.B I_GERROPT
is a

specific input-output control command.  The default settings are as though the option did not exist.
Therefore, there are no portability issues in not using this command.

compatibility, see
