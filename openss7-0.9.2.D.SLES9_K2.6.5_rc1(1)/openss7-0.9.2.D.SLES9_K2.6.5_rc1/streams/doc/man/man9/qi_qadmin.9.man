.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR qi_qadmin ()
is one of 5 principal synchronous entry points into a
.I STREAMS
mdoule or driver that form part of the definition of the driver and module.
The principal entry points are
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_qadmin (),
.IR qi_putp (9),
and
.IR qi_srvp (9).
The
.IR qi_qadmin ()
routine is specified in the read queue
.BR qinit (9)
structure that is associated with a new queue pair forming an instance of the driver or module from
the definitions in the driver and module defining
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.
.PP
The
.IR qi_qadmin ()
routine is not called by
.I STREAMS
and is primarily reserved for future use.
A driver or module writer can obtain a function pointer to an administrative routine for a module or
driver using the
.BR getmid (9)
and
.BR getadmin (9)
.I STREAMS
utility functions.
.PP
Although
.B qi_qadmin_t
is delcared to accept no arguments, cooperating modules can declare function prototype different
from that provided and cast the function pointer returned from
.BR getadmin (9)
to the appropriate type before invoking the routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.IR qi_qadmin ()
routine was reserved for future use in
.IR "SVR 4.2"
and has not had any standard use applied since.
.I STREAMS
does not invoke this routine, but a driver or module may locate it and execute it using the
.BR getmid (9),
.BR getadmin (9),
and non-portable
.BR qadmin (9)
utility functions.
The routine may be defined for private use by drivers and modules.  Cooperating modules can alter
the prototype of the function to suit their needs.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
The return value for
.IR qi_admin ()
is declared as
.BR int .
Cooperating modules can alter the return type of the function pointer.

.SH STYLE
.PP
It is common practise to name
.IR qi_qadmin ()
routines
\(lq\fIprefix\fBadmin\fR(),\(rq
(where
.I prefix
is the configuration prefix chosen for the driver or module and typically derived from the name of
the driver or module, and which may contain a trailing underscore).

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.PP
.IR qi_qadmin ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42spg
.]
did not define a type for the prototype of a queue
.B admin
routine.  This was an embellishment that first appeared in
.IR OSF/1 \(rg " 1.1" ,
.[
osfspg
.]
and propagated to
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
and
.IR HP-UX \(rg.
.[
hpuxspg
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not directly reference the
.B qi_qadmin_t
type.
.IP \(em
.IR "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr42spg
.]
indicates that this function is reserved for future use and that the corresponding
.I qi_qadmin
member in the
.BR qinit (9)
structure is always set to
.BR NULL .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use this function and will specify
.B NULL
in the
.I qi_qadmin
member of the
.BR qinit (9)
structures forming the definintion of the driver or module in the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.
.IP \(em
.IR "SVR 4.2"
largely used non-prototype declarations through the operating system code.  As such, it was not
necessary to cast the function pointer returned from
.BR getadmin (9)
to alter the arguments (just the return value).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules, when using this function, will cast the returned function pointer from
.BR getadmin (9)
to the agreed function prototype declaration type.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.

.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" .
.[
svr42spg
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
At one point it was considered that the
.I STREAMS
subsystem would have its own administration tools separate from character special files in the
.IR UNIX \(rg
system.  This approach was abandonned and
.I STREAMS
devices rely on the same tools as the character devices that preceded them.  This is likely why this
entry point has never seen any stadard use.  Some implementations overload it.
.PP
The
.B qi_qadmin_t
type first appeared in
.IR OSF/1 \(rg " 1.1" .
.[
osfspg
.]
.PP
The queue
.IR qi_qadmin ()
admin routine first appeared in
.IR "SVR 3" .
