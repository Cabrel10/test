.SH NAME
.B put, puthere, streams_put
\- invoke the put procedure for a \fISTREAMS\fP module or driver with a \fISTREAMS\fP message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void put(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to which to put the message.
.TP
.I mp
the message to put to the queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR put ()
calls the
.I q->q_info->qi_putp
procedure associated with the passed in queue, with the arguments
.IR q " and " mp .
.PP
As a side-effect,
.BR put ()
will wake up any processes waiting with
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9)
on the specified queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR put ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR put ()
fails silently when a queue band structure cannot be allocated for the band
specified in
.IR mp->b_band .
The caller can ensure that a queue band structure exists for the band in
question by calling
.BR strqset (9)
for the band.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR put ()
can be called from any context; however,
if called from interrupt service routine context, calling of the queue's put
procedure will be deferred and run under soft interrupt context the next time
that the
.I STREAMS
soft interrupt is scheduled to run.
See also
.BR putnext (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR put ()
is MP-safe.  The driver or module put procedures invoked must also be MP-safe.
.PP
Under
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
any
.BR put ()
procedure could be executed concurrently with any queue
.BR qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR put (),
.BR srv (9)
procedure,
.BR esbbcall (9),
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR timeout (9),
.BR qtimeout (9)
callback function,
or interrupt service routine.
The
.BR put ()
procedure itself must perform its own mutual exclusion.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR put ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR put ()
called with invalid arguments will have undefined results.
.I LiS
fails silently when
.IR mp " or " q
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.I q
does not reference a valid queue structure,
or
.I q->q_info
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.I q->q_info->qi_putp
is
.BR NULL .
When
.I LiS
fails silently, it frees
.I mp
using
.BR freemsg (9).
.IP \(em
.BR put ()
cannot be invoked while
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is in effect for
.IR q
because no other queue has a references to the queue for which
.BR qprocsoff (9)
has been executed, or for which
.BR qprocson (9)
has not yet been executed.
.I LiS
discards messages passed to
.BR lis_safe_putmsg ()
when 
.BR qprocsoff (9)
has been executed for
.IR q .
It is invalid to call
.BR put ()
for a queue that has not had
.BR qprocson (9)
called, or which has called
.BR qprocsoff (9),
so this difference should not present a problem.
.IP \(em
.BR put (),
.BR putnext (9),
.BR qreply (9)
will invoke a queue's put procedure shared and multi-threaded.
This is equivalent to
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers with the
.B D_MP
flag set or with the
.B D_MTPUTSHARED
flag set.
.IP \(em
.BR put ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR put ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR put ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
Under
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
this function is called
.BR puthere ().
.IP \(em
.BR puthere ()
is an
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  The more common
.BR put ()
function should be called in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR puthere ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structure and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR puthere ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR puthere ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.IP \(em
Under
.IR HP-UX \(rg
this function is called
.BR streams_put ().
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
is an
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  The more common
.BR put ()
function should be called in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structure and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR streams_put ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR streams_put ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.IP \(em
.I LiS
holds an exclusive nesting queue procedures lock while calling
.BR put ().
Unfortunately, these locks disable interrupts, meaning that interrupts are
disabled while
.BR put ()
executes.
.I LiS
.BR lis_safe_putnext (9)
and
.BR lis_safe_qreply (9)
also call this function, meaning that all message passing functions in
.I LiS
lock out interrupts until the entire thread of execution completes.
.I  LiS
drivers and modules calling
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
.BR put ()
should notice superior interrupt service routine latency and performance.  It
is normally the case that put procedures are MP-safe as then normally use only
MP-safe queue and message utility functions.  Also, most put procedures are
inherently invoked single threaded (from a single-threaded service procedure).
Lack of locking should not present a problem.
.IP ""
Because
.I LiS
also uses this lock for service procedures, this means that while the
.I LiS
scheduler is running (at kernel thread priority 50), interrupts,
timeouts, bottom halves, hi tasklets and soft interrupts are indefinitely
postponed.  This is not acceptable for soft-real-time performance.  Rewrite
.I LiS
put procedures to be MP-safe.
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_safe_putmsg ()
is provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_safe_putmsg ()
simply calls
.BR put ()
directly.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR osfcompat (9),
.BR hpuxcompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
