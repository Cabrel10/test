/*
 *  Simple locks, no nesting (not required).  Write locks suppress interrupts; read locks only
 *  suppress the STREAMS softirq for stream heads, but also suppresses local interrupts for freeze
 *  and queue read locks.  This allows read locks to be taken on the stream head in all contexts,
 *  and write locks to be taken in process context and STREAMS softirq.
 *
 *  Freeze write locks can be taken from hard irq context, so both freeze read and write locks
 *  suppress hard interrupts, but read locks are only taken for a later write lock on a queue, and
 *  queue write locks can be taken from hard irq.  This also means tha queue read locks need to
 *  suppress interrupts.
 *
 *  This means that it is safe to call any queue handling functions from in_irq().  There are a
 *  couple of notes: putq() can be called from in_irq().  put() can be called from in_irq(), but it
 *  might defer calling the put() procedure until STREAMS next executes (at bottom half).
 *
 *  It is safe to call queue handling utilities (and a host of other queue specific utilities) from
 *  bottom half, atomic or process context (!in_streams() && !in_irq)).  None of the xxxnext
 *  functions can be called from this context.  To call xxxnext utilities, first enter STREAMS
 *  context by taking a STREAM head read lock (this is what the STREAM head itself does).
 *
 *  It is safe to call all queue handling functions from within a queue open, close, put or service
 *  procedure.  Callbacks (bufcall, esballoc, timeout) that were invoked from within a queue open,
 *  close, put or service procedure are also safe.  bufcall(), timeout() callbacks invoked from
 *  outside of one of these queue procedures or queue syncrhonized callbacks, will run within the
 *  STREAMS environment, but will lack the STREAM head read locks necessary to use the xxxnext
 *  functions.
 *
 *  The same is true when transferring across a multiplexing driver.  When an upper or lower queue
 *  procedure executes queue handling functions on the queue pair opposite the side of the
 *  procedure, the xxxnext utilities cannot be used.  The same situation is true across the twist in
 *  a FIFO or pipe, pseudo-terminal, or any other pair of welded queues.  In some of these
 *  circumstances it is possible to take a STREAM head lock with the more portable MPSTR_STPLOCK()
 *  functions compatible with UnixWare.  (Basically a swlock().)
 *
 *  Also, getq() and putbq() must only be used from with a queue service procedure.

/* The following are like _bh, but _str for STREAMS scheduler.  These lock out the STREAMS scheduler
 * from interrupting the current thread and attempting to take a plumbing write lock for a weldq(9)
 * or unweldq(9) operation while the current context is holding a plumbing read lock.  Because the
 * STREAMS scheduler can only interrupt a process context when it runs at bottom half, there is no
 * need to lock out the STREAMS scheduler when running as a kernel thread.  This is good for kernel
 * threads on UP because taking a plumbing read lock becomes a no-op. */

 * from entering a put or service procedure and keeping other threads from reading or writing
 * any queue structure in the Stream.  These locks are recursive in the sense that the caller of the
 * write lock can acquire the read lock as well, permitting many functions that would otherwise
 * not be able to be called on a frozen Stream, may be called under Linux Fast-STREAMS.
 *
 * Note that locking out interrupts and the STREAMS scheduler prevents concurrent attempts on the
 * same processor to reaqcuire the lock.

/* plumbing locks */

/* Plumbing locks protect the q_next pointers in a Stream.  All utilities that need q_next
 * protection take a read lock.  A read lock is taken before a put or service procedure is called
 * and released afterward.  Stream head open()/close(), I_(P)LINK/I_(P)UNLINK operations take a
 * plumbing write lock (at user context) before replumbing a Stream.  (Note that open()/close(),
 * I_(P)LINK/I_(P)UNLINK operations effective have a read lock because they hold the STRWOPEN bit so
 * that no other open()/close(), I_(P)LINK/I_(P)UNLINK operations can occur on the Stream.)
 *
 * Unfortunately, there are two instances where a plumbing write lock will be taken by the STREAMS
 * scheduler: those are when performing weldq(9)/unweldq(9) operations.  Therefore, whenever we take
 * a plumbing read lock, we need to lockout the STREAMS scheduler temporarily.

/* Queue structure locks are basic reader-writer locks with the exception that a freeze read lock is

 * from putting messages on or off a queue or otherwise affecting the state of a queue in the frozen
 * Stream.
 *
 * Whether queue read locks should take a freeze read lock is a matter of whether freezestr(9)
 * really allows the caller to manipulate thing about a queue other than simply putting messages on
 * and off it.  Because strqset(9) cannot change much, and it is the only recommended way of
 * accessing queue or queue band data structures, we don't take a freeze read lock. */
