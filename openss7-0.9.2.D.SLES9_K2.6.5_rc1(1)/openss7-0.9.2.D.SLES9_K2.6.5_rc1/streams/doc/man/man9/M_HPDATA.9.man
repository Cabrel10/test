.SH NAME
.B M_HPDATA
\- \fISTREAMS\fP high priority data message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_HPDATA
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_HPDATA
message is a high priority message that consists of one
.B M_HPDATA
message block followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_HPDATA
is an
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfspg
.]
implementation specific message that is generated and used internally by the
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
implementation of
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.PP
.B M_HPDATA
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_HPDATA
messages arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_HPDATA
message arriving at a driver can be discarded (ignored and freed).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The use of the
.B M_HPDATA
message is poorly documented and it is not intended to be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
One can only assume that it is used by the
Stream head
to place the data part of a message back on the
Stream head
read queue that has had a high priority control part (i.e.,
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block) removed.
.PP
The
.B M_HPDATA
message will not be passed down a Stream from the Stream head.
.PP
Modules or drivers receiving this message type should treat it as a high priority message of unknown
type.  That is:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Modules receiving the
.BR H_HPDATA
message should pass it along as any unknown high priority message type.  The message is of high
priority and should not be subject to flow control.
.IP \(bu
A driver reecieving the
.BR M_HPDATA
message should discard the message as an unknown message type.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR datab (9),
.BR msgb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_HPDATA
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfdoc
.]
and
.IR "Mac OT" \(rg
.[
macspg
.]
document the
.BR M_HPDATA (9)
data block type.
This data block type is provided for source compatibility with drivers written
for
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
and
.IR "Mac OT" \(rg,
and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
It might be necessary to define
.B _OSF_SOURCE
before including
.B sys/stream.h
to expose this symbol.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.BR M_HPDATA (9)
data block type.
.IP \(em
The
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
Stream head does not use this message type and will discard it if it arrives at the Stream head.
.IP \(em
.B M_HPDATA
has a different constant value under
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR osfcompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
