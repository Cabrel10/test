\- pull up bytes in a \fISTREAMS\fP message to meet physical requirements

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message to pull up.
.PD 0
.TP
.I len
the number of bytes to pull up.
.TP
.I prp
physical requirements for the pulled up message.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
will copy and align
.I len
bytes from the message pointed to by
.I mp
into a new message, if possible, whose pointer is returned.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains more bytes than specified by
.IR len ,
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
will copy the remaining bytes onto the end of the new message.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains less than
.I len
bytes,
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL .
If
.I len
is specified as -1,
all the bytes of the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
will be concatenated, copied and aligned into the new message.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is a non-portable function and is largely deprecated.  For better approaches, where only the
data buffer has physical memory requirements, allocate the memory with a suitable memory allocator,
copy the data with
.BR bcopy (9),
and then use
.BR esballoc (9)
to acquire a message header.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
returns a pointer to the new message.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the number of bytes in the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
is less than
.IR len ;
and when allocation for the new message fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is MP-safe.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure exclusive access to
the passed in message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
function:
.B _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
fails if the requested physical requirements do not match those that already exist for the message
block.  Otherwise,
.BR msgpullup (9)
is called.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR msgpullup (9),
.BR uw7compat (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
does not perform alignment of the copied in bytes and will leave bytes in
place without proper alignment.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is compatible with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7doc
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is a fake that simply returns
.B NULL
if the requested physical requirements are not already met and then calls
.BR msgpullup (9).
Avoid use of this function if at all possible.
.IP \(em
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is an
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR msgpullup (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR UnixWare \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR UnixWare \(rg
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR msgpullup_physreq ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR uw7compat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for more compatibility information.
