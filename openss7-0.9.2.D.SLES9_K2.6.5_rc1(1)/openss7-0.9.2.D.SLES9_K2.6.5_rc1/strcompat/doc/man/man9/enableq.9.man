.TH ENABLEQ 9 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B enableq
\- schedules a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue service routine
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int enableq(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to enable.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR enableq ()
schedules the service procedure of the queue pointed to by
.I q
to be run by
.BR runqueues (9).
If the queue pointed to by
.I q
does not have a service proceedure (i.e.
.I q->q_info->qi_srvp
is
.BR NULL )
or has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable (9),
then
.BR enableq ()
will fail to schedule the service procedure.
Whether the queue can be scheduled with
.BR enableq ()
can be determined to some degree with a call to
.BR canenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is normally called to indirectly invoke the execution of
.IR q 's
service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR enableq ()
successfully schedules the queue service procedure with
.BR qschedule (9),
it returns true (1).  When
.BR enableq ()
fails to schedule the queue service procedure, it returns false (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
silently if the
.B QNOENB
flag was set by
.BR noenable (9)
for the queue,
.IR q ,
or fi the queue has no service procedure
.RI ( q->q_info->qi_srvp
is
.BR NULL ).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR enableq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
If the queue was not already enabled
.RB ( srv (9)
procedure already scheduled to run) on a different CPU,
.BR enableq ()
schedules the service procedure of
.I q
on the current CPU.  In this case, the queue service procedure for
.I q
will not execute until after
.BR enableq ()
returns and the function that called
.BR enableq ()
returns or encounters a preemption point.
However, if the queue is already scheduled by another processor  and
.BR enableq ()
was not called from a context synchronous with the service procedure, another
processor may run the service procedure before
.BR enableq ()
returns.
.PP
Therefore,
.BR enableq ()
should be called with
.I STREAMS
synchronization in effect, or hold the necessary private locks across the
call to
.BR enableq (),
if it is ncessary to synchronize the call to
.BR enableq ()
with execution of the service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR enableq ()
fails and returns false (0) if
.B QNOENB
is set.
.PP
If the queue has already been enabled due to internal
.I STREAMS
scheduler actions, or a previous call to
.BR qschedule (9)
that has not yet completed service,
.BR enableq ()
will have no effect.
.PP
Enabling a queue from within its own service procedure,
.BR srv (9),
will not reschedule the service procedure.

.BR canenable (9),
.BR noenable (9),
.BR enableok (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR enableq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR enableq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR enableq ()
will only schedule the queue for later service.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
