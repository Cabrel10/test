.HP 12
.BI "int " fd " = open(" /dev/echo ", " oflag );
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
is a file descriptor for an echo stream opened using the
.BR open (2s)
system call on one of the following devices:
.TP
.RB \*(lq /dev/echo \*(rq
This device is accessible to all users.
.PP
The
.B echo
device is characterized by the following behaviour:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Most 
.I STREAMS
messages written to the driver's write queue are echoed back to the stream
head read queue.  These messages include:
.BR M_DATA,
.BR M_PROTO,
and
.BR M_PCPROTO .
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.B echo
does not support any I/O controls of its own and all I/O controls delivered
will return an
.IR errno (3)
of
.BR [ EOPNOTSUPP ].
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B echo
device can be opened when no other suitable device exists and modules may be
pushed on the
.B echo
device.
.PP
The primary use of the
.B echo
device is the
.I STREAMS
verification utility
.BR strvf (8).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B echo
device is used on
.IR HP-UX \(rg
systems in support of the
.BR strvf (8)
utility.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides this device in support of
.BR strvf (8)
and for compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B echo
is implemented as a regular
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver.
