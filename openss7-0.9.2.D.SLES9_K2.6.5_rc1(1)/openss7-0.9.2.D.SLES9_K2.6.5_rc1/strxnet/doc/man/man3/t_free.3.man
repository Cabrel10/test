.SH NAME
.B t_free
\- free an XTI/TLI library structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_free(void *" ptr ", int " type );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to the structure to free.
.TP
.I type
the type of the structure pointed to.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_free ()
frees an XTI/TLI structure that was allocated with the
.BR t_alloc (3)
call or allocated using
.BR malloc (3).
.PP
.I ptr
is a pointer to a structure that was allocated with
.BR t_alloc "(3) or " malloc (3).
.PP
.I type
is the structure type to deallocated, and may be one of the following:
.TP
.B T_BIND
specifies the
.B t_bind
structure.
.TP
.B T_OPTMGMT
specifies the
.B t_optmgmt
structure.
.TP
.B T_CALL
specifies the
.B t_call
structure.
.TP
.B T_DIS
specifies the
.B t_discon
structure.
.TP
.B T_UNITDATA
specifies the
.B t_unitdata
structure.
.TP
.B T_UDERROR
specifies the
.B t_uderr
structure.
.TP
.B T_INFO
specifies the
.B t_info
structure.
.PP
In addition to freeing the structure,
.BR t_free ()
will free any buffers still attached to
.BR netbuf (3)
parameters within the structure.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_free ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_free ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_free ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TNOSTRUCTYPE ]
The argument \fItype\fR was not a valid or supported structure type.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
.BR t_free ()
has no known bugs.
.BR t_free ()
has been tested for the described behavior using the
.BR test-xnet (8)
and
.BR test-xnet_thr (8)
conformance test suites.
