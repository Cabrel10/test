\- named \fISTREAMS\fP device

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stropts.h>
.HP
.BI "int " fd " = open(" \*(lq/dev/xxx.yyy\*(rq ", " oflags );
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B nsdev
is a \*(lqNamed
.I STREAMS
Device\*(rq pseudo-device driver similar in some
respects to
.BR clone (4).
.B nsdev
is perhaps the only assigned major device number that is ever needed by a
.I STREAMS
device driver.
.PP
Whereas the
.BR clone (4)
pseudo-device driver transforms the device number
.I dev
into
.BI makedevice(getminor( dev "), " 0 ),
the
.B nsdev
pseudo-device driver transforms the device number
.I dev
into
.BI makedevice( major ", getminor(" dev )),
where
.I major
is determined from the name of the device rather than the device number.
.PP
To determine the
.I major
component of the device number,
.B nsdev
looks for a registered
.I STREAMS
device with the same initial substring (before a dot) as the name of the device opened
.RI ( xxx
in the
.RI \(lq SYNOPSIS \(rq
above).
.PP
If no registered
.I STREAMS
device can be found that match the initial substring,
.IR xxx ,
of the device name, the
.B nsdev
requests that the kernel load the module named
.BI streams- xxx\fR,
where
.I xxx
is the longest initial substring of the device name that does not contain a
period (\(lq.\(rq) character.  This makes it possible to create Named
.I STREAMS
Devices knowing only the character major device number associated with the
.B nsdev
driver and demand load other
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers that may then dynamically allocate their major device
numbers (or not allocate any major device numbers at all).
.PP
For additional information on device numbers, see the
.RI \(lq "Device Numbering" \(rq
section of the
.BR dev_t (9).
.\"
.SS
Super Cloning
.PP
The
.B nsdev
supports the concept of super cloning when used in conjunction with the
traditional
.BR clone (4)
device.
A super clone device has the clone device major device number as a major
number and the
.B nsdev
major device number as a minor number.  This is a traditional clone device
application to the
.B nsdev
pseudo-device driver.
This arrangement has the characteristic that when such a
.BR clone (4)
device is opened, it chains the open call to the
.B nsdev
with the
.B CLONEOPEN
flag set in
.IR sflag .
The Named
.I STREAMS
Device then chains the open to the device number derived
from the device name and the minor device number (in this case zero (0)) as
normal.
.\"
.SS
Named Clone Devices
.PP
The
.B nsdev
can be used to create named clone devices.  A named clone device can be
created by assigning the
.B ndev
major device number to devices with the name
.BI clone. yyy
and assigning the traditional clone device minor number (see
.BR clone (4)).
In this way, it is not even necessary to know the device major number of the
.BR clone (4)
device.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Performing an
.BR open (2s)
of the
.B nsdev
can result in the loading of (or an attempt to load) the kernel module
named
.BI streams- xxx\fR.
.PP
If the device opened is a symbolic link, the name of the actual file is the
name used for determining the
.I major
device number of the cloned device.
If the device opened is a hard link, the name of the opened file is the name
used for determining the
.I major
device number of the cloned device.
.PP
.B nsdev
is used by the
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
system provided drivers to limit the use of major device numbers to a single
major device number for the
.I STREAMS
system installed device drivers.
Clonable minor devices are allocated against a single
.I STREAMS
system major device number rather than allocating new major device numbers for
each facility.
.PP
When
.B nsdev
loads, it assigns a major device number either statically or dynamically.  In
either event, the major device number associated with the
.B nsdev
can be found by search the
.B /proc/devices
file for the major device number assigned to
.RB \*(lq nsdev \*(rq.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B nsdev
is not implemented as a normal
.I STREAMS
driver: it is implemented as a shadow special device node under
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
shadow special device nodes call
.BR nsdev_open ()
from
.BR cdev_open ()
instead of
.BR spec_open ()
permitting the
.B nsdev
device to intercept and redirect the open call to the appropriate device.
This is consitent with the descriptions for the internal
.BR clone_open ()
under
.IR "SVR 4" .

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following are some examples of how to use the
Named
.I STREAMS
Device:
.SS
Named
.I STREAMS
Device Example
.PP
If the following is performed to create the device (assuming that major device
number 56 is the major device number of the Named
.I STREAMS
Device):
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> mknod -m 0666 /dev/mystream.04 c 56 3
$> ln -s /dev/mystream.04 /dev/ticlts
\s+1\fP
.fi
.sp
then opening
.RB \*(lq /dev/ticlts \*(rq
will result in opening minor device number
.I 3
of the
.RB \*(lq mystream \*(rq
device.
The device will be opened with the
.I sflag
argument to
.BR qopen (9)
set to
.B DRVOPEN
unless the device has had cloning set using
.BR D_CLONE
during registration of the major or minor device nodes (see
.BR register_strdev (9)),
or unless
.BR SAP_CLONE
was set using the
.I STREAMS
Administrative Driver
.BR sad (4)
for the ultimate device node.  In either of these later cases, the device will
be opened with a
.I sflag
argument of
.BR CLONEOPEN .
.SS
Super Clone Example
.PP
If the following is performed to create a
.BR clone (4)
device in addition to the above example (assuming that the
.BR clone (4)
major device number is 74):
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
$> mknod -m 0666 /dev/mystream.00 c 56 0
$> mknod -m 0666 /dev/mystream c 74 56
$> ln -s /dev/mystream my_super_clone_device
\s+1\fP
.fi
.sp
then opening either
.RB \*(lq my_super_clone_device \*(rq
or
.RB \*(lq /dev/mystream \*(rq
will result in opening minor device number
.I 0
of the
.RB \*(lq mystream \*(rq
device with the
.I sflag
argument to
.BR qopen (9)
being set to
.BR CLONEOPEN .
