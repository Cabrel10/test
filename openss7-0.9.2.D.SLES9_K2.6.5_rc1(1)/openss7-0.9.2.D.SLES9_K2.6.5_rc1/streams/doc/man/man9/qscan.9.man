.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.I q
the queue to scan.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
uses
.BR qscan ()
to place one its write queues on the scan list
.I scanqhead
for coallescing writes with the
.B SO_STRHOLD
feature (see
.BR M_SETOPTS (9)).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.I STREAMS
provides a hold option that improves performance of
.I STREAMS
when the process issues many small writes.  The message hold option is enabled if the system
adminstrator has changed the system control,
.BR sys.streams.strhold ,
to be non-zero and if the Stream head flag
.B STRHOLD
is set by a driver or module.
A downstream driver or module sets the Stream head
.B STRHOLD
bit by issuing a
.BR M_SETOPTS (9)
message upstream with the
.BR SO_STRHOLD
flags bit set in the
.I so_flags
member of the
.BR stroptions (9)
structure contained in the message.  (The
.BR ldterm (4)
tty line discipline module does this.)  The process may also issue a
.BR I_SWROPT (7)
command to
.BR ioctl (2s)
with the
.BR STRHOLD
flag set in the argument to enable the hold option on a particular Stream, but this is a
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
extension.  Normally the hold option can only be activated and deactivated by a downstream module or
driver.
.PP
The message hold option exploits the fact that
.BR allocb (9)
allocates a buffer with a data size that is always equal to or greater than
.BR FASTBUF .
The buffer is allocated and the data is copied into it.
.BR write (2s)
then checks to see if another
.BR write (2s)
of the same size will fit into the same buffer.  If it will, the buffer is held temporarily on the
Stream head write queue, a timer is started (usually, 10 milliseconds, but settable with the
.BR sys.streams.rtime
system control), and the Stream head is linked onto the
.I scanqhead
list in the
.I STREAMS
scheduler by calling
.BR qscan ().
.PP
One of three things will then happen:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
A second
.BR write (2s)
occurs with a data part that is small enough to fit into the remaining portion of the saved buffer.
The data is put into the buffer and sent downstream.  Since two writes have been sent downstream in
one message, the optimization is successful.
.IP (2)
A second
.BR write (2s)
occurs with a data portion that is too big to fit into the remaining portion of the saved buffer.
The saved message is sent downstream followed by another message holding the data of the second
.BR write (2s).
.IP (3)
No second
.BR write (2s)
occurs so the timer expires.  The timeout processing performed by
.BR queuerun (9)
scans the
.I scanqhead
list in the
.I STREAMS
scheduler and sends downstream any messages held on the Stream head write queue whose timeouts have
expired.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qscan ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qscan ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qscan ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qscan ()
is processor-specific and inherently MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qscan ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that was not intended to be called by the
.I STREAMS
driver or module writer.
.BR qscan ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.
.BR qscan ()
is highly implementation dependent in function and prototype.  Use of this function by a driver or
module will guarantee that it is not portable even between release of
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
In implementation it is not too difficult to multiplex a single timer against the
.I scanqhead list, rather than setting a timer per Stream.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP

.IR "SVR 4 STREAMS"
in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden Explained"

.IP ""

.I LiS
chooses the expensive route of running a 10 millisecond timer per Stream
with the feature.  Since 10 milliseconds is a single tick on older
.B Linux
kernels, it is a particularly bad idea to run may single-tick timers.
.IP ""
.I STREAMS
