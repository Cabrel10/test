.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B nullmod
is a
.I STREAMS
module that is pushed over any
.IR Stream ,
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR fifo (4).
.PP
Aside from being a
.I STREAMS
module,
.B nullmod
performs no actions.  All messages passed from the
.I Stream head
toward the
.B nullmod
module are passed on downstream from the
.B nullmod
write-side
.B put
procedure (with
.BR putnext (9));
all messages received from the driver,
are passed on upstream from the
read-side
.B put
procedure.  The
.B nullmod
module has no write- or read-side
.B service
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The primary purpose of
.B nullmod
is as a test module for use with the
.BR test-streams (8)
conformance test program.  The other purpose of
.B nullmod
is as an example skeleton for a
.I STREAMS
pushable module.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR nullmod
is implementation-specific to the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The source code for
.B nullmod
serves as an example skeleton for a
.I STREAMS
pushable module.
.\"
