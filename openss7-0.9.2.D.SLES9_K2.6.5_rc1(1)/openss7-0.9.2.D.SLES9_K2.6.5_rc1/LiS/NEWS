* Major changes in LiS-2.18.4.rc2

  Second release candidate.

* Major changes in LiS-2.18.4rc1

  Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

* Major changes in LiS-2.18.4

  Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
  Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

* Major changes in LiS-2.18.3

  Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
  x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
  compiler warnings.

  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
  mailing list.  Builds on FC4 2.6.15 kernel and with gcc 4.0.2.

  Added in many of Paul's 64-bit corrections.

  The package is still largely unusable on 64-bit or SMP kernels.  Linux
  STREAMS IS DEPRECATED.  DO NOT USE IT.  THE PACKAGE CONTAINS MANY
  URESOLVED BUGS.  USE Linux Fast-STREAMS INSTEAD.

* Major changes in LiS-2.18.2

  Cross-build support for newer `NexusWare' releases.  Build support for
  (recent FC4) 2.6.14 kernel.  Corrected installation support (init
  scripts) for SuSE 9.2.

  Binary compatibility backwards compatible to GCOM 2.18.0 included.
  This includes exported symbols changed to not generate versioned
  symbols on 2.4 kernels.  Also, exported symbols are always compiled
  `attribute((regparm(0)))' on regparm capable architectures, regardless
  of the kernel version or compile options.(1).  For actual binary
  compatibilty packaging, see the `strcompat' package.

  A major change for 2.18.2 is the port-back of POSIX/SUSv3 XSR/XSI
  conformance test suites and performance programs from Linux
  Fast-STREAMS.  The purpose of porting back theses tests suites and
  supporting modules and drivers is to provide the ability to do
  comparison tests between LiS and Linux Fast-STREAMS.

  Another change is a module unloading safe vstrlog hook register and
  unregister functions register_strlog() and unregister_strlog().

  Some bug corrections and fixes for glaring SMP errors reported by
  Kutluck.

  This might be the last OpenSS7 release of Linux STREAMS.  You should
  seriously consider using the Linux Fast-STREAMS package
  (streams-0.7a.4 or later) instead.  If you need comptibility to LiS
  (or other STREAMS implementation), investigate the strcompat package,
  which provides some binary compatibility to LiS under Linux Fast
  STREAMS.

* Major changes in LiS-2.18.1

  This is a port forward of most of the build and patches from 2.16.19
  forward and applied over 2.18.0.  This is our first LiS-2.18 release.
  All further development on 2.16.19 will now cease.  2.18.1 is
  maintained on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  No active development will be
  performed on 2.18.1, only maintenance.  For an active development
  release, see the Linux Fast-STREAMS releases.

  Major changes from LiS-2.18.0 include all of the autoconf build
  system, manual pages and texi/pdf manual for LiS that were applied on
  the 2.16.19 release.  This includes a number of 64 bit, HPPA, PARISC,
  printf, atomic stats, HZ calculations for 64bit machines, DMA patch
  for mblk buffer alignment, flush handling patch, panic patch, smp
  patch, parisc syscall patch, appq patch, and multithreaded test
  program patches, POSIX threads compilant library functions.

  Additional changes made to support later 2.6 kernels and
  distributions.  Switched putpmsg()/getpmsg() to use ioctl for system
  call emulation instead of read()/write(), primarily because 2.6.11
  kernels check for a valid count before calling the driver's
  read()/write() file operations.  Updates to the build system to
  support a wider range of kernels and distributions.  See the
  installation and reference manual for a complete list of supported
  kernels and distributions.

  Please note that the entire package is released under GPL.

  For the next release I will make an attempt to collect all of the
  2.18.0 patches that were reported to the LiS mailing list.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.19-1

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-22

  Replaced m4 and automake files with common equivalents.  This allows
  the same set of m4 macros and automake fragments to be used with all
  of the OpenSS7 release packages.  Maintenance is easier as one
  correction will propagate across all items.  Performed similar
  function with texinfo documentation pieces.

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-21

  Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and
  documentation from LiS distribution and bumped epoch to 2.  Linux
  networking code has been migrated to the strxns, strxnet, strinet and
  strsctp packages.  The purpose for doing this was to allow the Linux
  networking to build against Linux Fast-STREAMS as well as Linux
  STREAMS and is a preparation for phasing out LiS and phasing in LfS.
  Updated texinfo documentation to reflect.

  Made a number of spec file improvements.  Improved passing of options
  from configure script to rpmbuild.

  Corrected generations of versioned module symbols to generate symbols
  both for SMP and non-SMP architectures.  This allows a single
  installed module versions header file to provide for both SMP and
  non-SMP kernels on the same machine based on the presence or absence
  of CONFIG_SMP.  Provided the same mechanism for SuSE CONFIG_REGPARM.

  Added missing configure.nexusware to distribution.  LiS cache options
  now default to 'no' because of instabilities with timers.

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-20

  Minor corrections: made conflicting manpage xti_sctp.3 dependent on
  OpenSS7 SCTP kernel.

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-19

  Changes to ompile, install and builds rpms for Fedora Core 1 (FC1),
  Whitebox Enterprise Linux (WBEL) and RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 (EL3).
  Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in spec file for RPM
  versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and
  moved getpmsg and putpmsg manual pages.

  Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during
  non-rpm autoconf installation.

  Correction to zero maxlen behavior in t_rcvconnect().

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-18

  Added check for CONFIG_REGPARM, addition of -mregparm=3 CFLAGS,
  addition of regparm_ prefix for exported ksyms.

  Minor corretions to separate build directory install of devices and
  caching of detected ksyms.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-17

  Added option --disable-k-modversions to supress versioning of LiS
  exported symbols.

  A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.
  Changed order of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so
  that the rpm debug package is built correctly on RH9.

  Change MODULE_PARM to static so that make install-strip does not strip
  module parameter symbols.

  Added lis_check_mem_region(), lis_release_mem_region() and
  lis_request_mem_region() for memory mapped io instead of just io.

  Added printk patches discussed on linux-stream mailling list.  Added
  gcc printf checking and corrected errors in LiS debugging printk
  statements.

  Added HP patches.  There are a couple of questionable components in
  the HP patches that I reversed.  They include;

  - modification of lis_msgsize to lis_msgdsize.  This would change the
    calculation of queue counts.  Queue counts aren't M_DATA counts,
    they are "data" message counts.  LiS probably doesn't have this the
    right way, but lis_msgdsize is not correct either.

  - addition of qi_mstat->ms_pcnt increment on lis_safe_putmsg.  Same
    for ms_scnt, ms_ocnt, ms_ccnt.  STREAMS is not supposed to increment
    counts.  It is the module writer's responsibility to increment
    counts in their own queue procedures.

  Added HP ldl patches.

  Made modifications to putq(), putbq(), insq() and appq() discussed on
  linux-streams mailing list.  These do not free messages on failure.
  Modified all ocurrences internal to LiS to free the message on error
  to ensure old behavior.

  Added HP dejagnu patches to strtst and added dejagnu testsuite
  directory and file.  Added the make check target.  Use DEJATOOLS on
  the make command line to invoke the tests, such as  `make
  DEJATOOLS=strtst check' to invoke the tests.  Because a patched
  netperf is not commonly available and netperf will not be distributed
  with the package, gnu autotest might be a better choice.  But that's
  for a later release.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-16

  General updates to the build process, optimization options, build
  options.  Corrected library linkage.  Synced TLI modules and INET
  driver to Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Removed deadlock from INET driver and
  loosened locking.  Unfortunately suitable libraries must be installed
  before distcheck will clear.

  Smoother and more reliable stripping of kernel symbols, starts with
  /proc/ksyms if applicable then System.map then modversions.h to
  attempt to choose symbols most closely synced with an installed or
  running kernel.

  Improvements to autoconf installation of manpages (autocompressed now)
  and info and pdf manuals are distributed.  install-strip target will
  actually properly strip kernel modules.

  Included an option to build and install only kernel or user parts of
  package to speed rpm rebuild process for multiple kernel.  Added
  `rebuild' target to rebuild the rpms from srpm for multiple kernel and
  architectures.  Added a `sign' and `resign' target to sign srpm and
  rebuilt rpms respectively.

  Greatly enhanced cross-build and cross-compile support, primarily in
  support of the NexusWare embedded target.  Added NexusWare helper
  script and documentation.  DESTDIR is now a blessed environment
  variable used by configure to set the cross-build root as well as the
  install root.  Try adding --with-k-optimize='size' to configure to
  optimize for size for embedded targets.  Builds clean against
  NexusWare24 (810p0674.10-rc4).

  Added start of an option to build as linkable object for embedded
  targets rather than loadable kernel module.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-15

  Fixed several symbol errors that made -13 and -14 unusable.  Corrected
  error in calculation of kernel debug flags.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-14

  A few more enhancements to the build process to work with autoconf
  2.59.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-13

  Enhanced build process for autoconf-2.59, automake-1.8.3,
  gettext-0.14.1, and libtool-1.5.6.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-12

  Added defaults for SK_WMEM_MAX and SK_RMEM_MAX for lastest 2.4.25 and
  2.4.26 kernel builds.

  Enhanced build process.
  
  All kernel symbols exported by LiS are versioned on kernels that have
  versioned symbols.  This makes it safer to compile kernel modules
  against kernel/LiS combinations.  This is in preparation for splitting
  off the strxnet package, and the technique was imported from the Linux
  Fast-STREAMS build.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-11

  Ripped three additional kernel symbols in support of INET driver that
  were missing in -10 release.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-10

  Added support for cooked manpages both for non-rpm systems and for rpm
  systems.  It is still better to leave manpages uncooked for rpm
  releases because they are much smaller that way.  Give the
  --with-cooked-manpages flag to configure if you want cooked manpages.
  You still need grefer on the build system.

  Updates to all manual pages in man7, and some others (xti) in man3.
  Removed unused .macros and .refs files.

  Moved automake fragments into separate directory.  Cleaned up automake
  fragments.

  Rearranged header files in the xti subdirectory to install in LiS
  package include directory instead.  Reworked xti, tihdr and tiuser
  file groups to include properly from kernel or user space independent
  of order.  tiuser and xti still cannot be included together.  Added
  older TLI interface <tiuser.h> that is still consistent with newer XTI
  interface.  Changed references in man pages to XTI/TLI instead of just
  XTI.

  Added ticlts.h, ticots.h and ticotsord.h header files.  Updated dlpi.h
  and npi.h header files.  Removed sys/LiS/tpicommon.h because it is
  largely replaced by sys/tli.h and sys/tpi.h.  Removed the, now
  redundant, xti header file subdirectory.

  A series of bug fixes to xnet.c (libxnet) that resulted from
  discussions with Gurol Akman on openss7-develop mailing list.  Mostly
  surrounding t_alloc and t_getinfo behaviour and the behavior when NULL
  pointers are passed to various XTI/TLI library calls.  Updated xti
  documentation as well.

  Many changes to the inet.c INET driver.  Wildcard IP addresses can now
  be bound and wildcard addresses will be assigned with no address is
  passed to most providers.  (/dev/rawip still requires an address or
  TNOADDR is returned.)  Option management has been extensively
  rewritten to be more conformant to XNS documentation.  Test programs
  test-inet_raw, test-inet_udp, test-inet_tcp have been upgraded and
  converted to multiple child processes.  A number of fixes to SMP lock
  behavior and M_FLUSH have beend added as reported by Dave Grothe.
  Corrected all level and TBADOPT behavior on negotiation.

  Although this driver is now closer to expected behavior, it has not
  been tested for XNS 5.2 compliance, nor will it be until someone has
  the time to extend the test programs to handle all test cases in a
  similar manner as was done for the library.  Your mileage many vary.
  Remember, there is no warranty.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-9

  Changes primarily in support of builds on HPPA (PARISC) architectures.
  LiS doesn't build too well on PARISC so some modifications where used
  from the Linux Fast-STREAMS package to correct deficiencies.  Better
  building on recent 2.4 kernels (2.4.23, 2.4.24, 2.4.25) is also
  provided.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-8

  Changes to permit better builds on recent RedHat kernels, and
  especially kernel-2.4.20-30.9.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-7

  Fixed a module loading bug in LiS.  Previously modules would not
  demand load.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-6

  Fixed a possible null pointer dereference in libxnet.  Corrected
  t_bind to return TNOADDR instead of TBADADDR on wildcard bind attempt.
  Module loading bug patched.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-5

  Fixes a t_open and t_bind problem in libxnet.  Fixes alignemnt of data
  portion of mblks.  Adds (untested) ticots_ord, ticots and ticlts
  devices over UNIX domain sockets.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-4

  Adds back in missing strms_up/down/status scripts to distribution and
  install.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-3

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-2

  Not publicly released.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.18-1

  Updated release to LiS-2.16.18.

* Major changes in LiS-2.16.16-1

  Initial autoconf/rpm packaging of LiS.

  We got tired of trying to stablize LiS loads, so we autoconf'ed it,
  rpm'ed it, added an XTI/TLI library that works, a tirdwr module that
  works, fixed tihdr and timod header files, pulled strinet into the
  build, added in manual pages, added --help and --version options to
  all the utilities to pass distcheck targets.

  This release will greatly simplify loading LiS for those that don't
  want to recompile kernels (or recompile anything for that matter).
