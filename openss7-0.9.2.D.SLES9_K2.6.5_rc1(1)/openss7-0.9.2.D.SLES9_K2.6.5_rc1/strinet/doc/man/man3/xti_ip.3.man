.B T_IP_OPTIONS
.\"IP per-packet options.
.\".sp
This option is used to set (retreive) the OPTIONS field of each outgoing
(incoming) IP datagram.  It value is a string of octets composed of a number
of T_IP options, whose format matches those defined in the IP specification
with one exception: the linst of addresses for the souce routing option must
include the first-hop gateway at the beginning of the list of gateways.  The
first-hop gateway address will be extracted from the option list and the size
adjusted accordingly before use.
.sp
The option is disabled if it is specified with \*(lqno value\*(rq; that is,
with an option header only.
.sp
The functions
.BR t_connect (3)
(in synchronous mode),
.BR t_listen "(3), " t_rcvconnect "(3) and " t_rcvudata (3)
return the OPTIONS field, if any, of the received IP datagram associated with
this call.  The function
.BR t_rcvuderr (3)
returns the OPTIONS field of the data unit previously sent that produced the
error.  The function
.BR t_optmgmt ()
with
.B T_CURRENT
set retrieves the currently effective
.B T_IP_OPTIONS
that is sent with outgoing datagrams.
.sp
Common application never need this option.  It is mainly used for network
debugging and control purposes.
.sp
This option is formated as an array (maximum 40 elements) of
.BR "unsigned char" .
This option is an
.IR "absolute requirement" .
This option has
.IR "end-to-end significance" .
.TP
.B T_IP_TOS
.\"IP per-packet type of service.
.\".sp
This option is used to set (retrieve) the type-of-service filed of an
outgoing (incoming)
.B T_IP
datagram.  This field can be constructed by any OR'ed combination of one of
the precedence flags and the type-of-service flags.
.RS

.BI SET_TOS( prec ", " tos )
.PP
The option value is set using the macro
.BI SET_TOS( prec ", " tos )\fR,
where
.I prec
is set to one of the precedence flags and
.I tos
to one or an OR'ed combination of the type-of-service flags.
.BR  SET_TOS ()
returns the option value.
.TP
.I prec
The precedence flags specify datagram precedence, allowing senders to
indicate the importance of each datagram.  They are intended for
Department of Defence applications.  Applications using
.B T_IP_TOS
but not the precedence level should use the value of
.B T_ROUTINE
for precedence.
.I prec
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP \w'T_OVERRIDEFLASH\(em'u
.B T_ROUTINE
routine.
.PD 0
.TP
.B T_PRIORITY

.TP
.B T_IP_TTL
.\"IP per-packet time to live.
.\".sp
This option is used to set the time-to-live field in an outgoing IP
datagram.  It specifies how long, in seconds, the datagram is allowed to
remain in the Internet.  The time-to-live field of an incoming datagram is
not returned by any function (since it is not an option with
.IR "end-to-end significance" ).

.TP
.B T_IP_REUSEADDR
.\"Allow local address reuse.
.\".sp
Many TCP implementations do not allow the user to bind more than one
transport endpoint address with identical port numbers.  If
.B T_IP_REUSEADDR
is set to
.B T_YES
this restriction is relaxed in the sense that it is now allowed to bind a
transport endpoint to an address with a port number and an underspecified
internet address (\*(lqwild card\*(rq address) and further endpoints to
addresses with the same port number and (mutually exclusive) fully specified
internet addresses.

.B T_IP_DONTROUTE
.\"Just use interface address.
.\".sp
This option indicates that outgoing messages should bypass the standard
routing facilities.  It is mainly used for testing and development.

It can take on values
.BR T_YES " or " T_NO .

.B T_IP_BROADCAST
.\"Permit sending of broadcast messages.

This option requests permission to send broadcast datagrams.  It was
defined to make sure that broadcasts are not generated by mistake.  The
use of this option is often restricted to privileged users.
