.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
creates an instance data structure and chains it into the list of module or driver instances.
In contrast to
.BR mi_open_comm (9),
.BR mi_open_detached ()
does not require an existing stream or module instance (queue) with which to associate the instance
data.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is typically called by modules or drivers that need to access a module or driver's instance data
before the stream is created.  When the module or driver's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure is later called, this instance can be used as the new queue's instance data by associating
it with the queue using
.BR mi_attach (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_open_detached ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the newly created module or driver instance data;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR mi_open_detached ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR mi_open_detached ()
fails when it cannot allocate memory for module or driver instance data.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.

.BR mi_open_detached ()

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_open_detached ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
