@c This file is include from install.texi and contains the descriptions for
@c package-specific enable/disable and with/without options

In addition, the following @command{configure} options, specific to the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are available:

@table @command

@item --enable-streams-syncqs
@opindex streams-syncqs
When enabled, MP syncrhonization queues are enabled for SMP kernels.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option is not tested for early releases.

@item --disable-streams-kthreads
@opindex streams-kthreads
When enabled, the STREAMS scheduler runs as a kernel thread.  When disabled, the STREAMS scheduler
runs as a software interrupt (bottom half).
Running the STREAMS scheduler at bottom half instead of a kernel thread breaks the @file{strinet}
driver, which must be able to invoke kernel functions that might sleep (but don't).
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --disable-streams-utils
@opindex streams-utils
I have experimented with putting the STREAMS utilities into their own package, @file{strutil},
however, this is not complete yet.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.

@item --disable-big-compile
@opindex big-compile
When enabled, the STREAMS, the Stream head, and the clone driver are all compiled together in one
big compilation unit.  This allows the compiler greater opportunity to optimize.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.

@item --enable-module-sth
@opindex module-sth
Enable @file{sth} (stream head) module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module,
unless option @samp{big-compile} is specified.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled} if @samp{big-compile} is enabled.

@item --enable-module-bufmod
@opindex module-bufmod
Enable @file{bufmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-nullmod
@opindex module-nullmod
Enable @file{nullmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-pipemod
@opindex module-pipemod
Enable @file{pipemod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-connld
@opindex module-connld
Enable @file{connld} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-sc
@opindex module-sc
Enable @file{sc} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-testmod
@opindex module-testmod
Enable @file{testmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-clone
@opindex driver-clone
Enable @file{clone} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module,
unless option @samp{big-compile} is specified.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled} if @samp{big-compile} is enabled.

@item --enable-driver-echo
@opindex driver-echo
Enable @file{echo} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-fifo
@opindex driver-fifo
Enable @file{fifo} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-log
@opindex driver-log
Enable @file{log} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-loop
@opindex driver-loop
Enable @file{loop} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-nsdev
@opindex driver-nsdev
Enable @file{nsdev} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-mux
@opindex driver-mux
Enable @file{mux} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-nuls
@opindex driver-nuls
Enable @file{nuls} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-pipe
@opindex driver-pipe
Enable @file{pipe} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-sad
@opindex driver-sad
Enable @file{sad} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-sfx
@opindex driver-sfx
Enable @file{sfx} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-spx
@opindex driver-spx
Enable @file{spx} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-streams-fifos
@opindex streams-fifos
Enable override of system fifos with STREAMS-based fifos.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option is not tested.  Do not enable this option yet.

@item --disable-streams-bcm
@opindex streams-bcm
Disable STREAMS binary compatibility mode.
When enabled, exported functions (and callouts) will always pass three arguments in registers on
architectures supporting @code{regparm} (i.e. @var{__i386__}, @var{__x86_64__}, @var{__k8__})
regardless of how the kernel was compiled.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
