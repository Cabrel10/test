.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/poll.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int poll(struct pollfd *" fds ", unsigned int " nfds ", int " timeout );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fds
a pointer to an array of
.B pollfd
structures describing the file descriptors and events to be polled.
.TP
.I nfds
the number of
.B pollfd
structures in the
.I fds
array.
.TP
.I timeout
a timeout, in milliseconds.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR poll ()
is called with a specification of the file descriptors and events to detect on those file
descriptors in the array pointed to by
.I fds .
The number of file descriptors to poll is provided in
.I nfds .
A time interval after which
.BR poll ()
will return if no other event is detected can be specified in milliseconds in the
.I timeout
argument.
.PP
Each file descriptor is described by a
.B pollfd
structure element in the array pointed to by the
.I fds
argument.
Each structure element contains the file descriptor to monitor in the
.I fd
member, and the event flags specifying the events to detect in the
.I events
member.  The
.I revents
is used by
.BR poll ()
to return the detected events, and is set for each element in the array prior to return.
.PP
The
.B pollfd
structure has members as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-2
struct pollfd {
        int fd;
        short events;
        short revents;
};
\s+2\fP
.fi
.TP
.I fd
specifies a file descriptor to poll.
.TP
.I events
specifies the events on this file descriptor that will cause
.BR poll ()
to exit.
See
.RI \*(lq EVENTS \*(rq,
below.
.TP
.I revents
specifies the status of the file descriptor upon successful return from
.BR poll .
See
.RI \*(lq EVENTS \*(rq,
below.
.\"
.\"
.SS EVENTS
.PP
Events that can be specified in the
.I events
member or indicated in the
.I revents
member are as follows:
.TP \w'POLLWRNORM\(em'u
.B POLLIN
Normal-priority data may be read from
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_DATA (9)
message (in any band) arrives at the stream head and is generated even when the
data available is of zero length.
See
.BR getmsg (2s).
.TP
.B POLLPRI
High-priority data may be read from
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
and
.BR M_DATA (9)
message arrives at the stream head and is generated even when the data available
is of zero length.
.TP
.B POLLOUT
Normal (band 0) data may be written to
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when band zero high water mark thresholds have
not been exceeded, or when band zero becomes back-enabled (falls below the low
water mark threshold).
.TP
.B POLLRDNORM
Normal (band 0) data may be read from
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_DATA (9)
message (in band zero (0)) arrives at the stream head and is generated even when
the data available is of zero length.
See
.BR getmsg (2s).
.TP
.B POLLRDBAND
Priority (band > 0) data may be read from
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_DATA (9)
message (in a band greater than zero) arrives at the stream head and is
generated even when the data available is of zero length.
See
.BR getpmsg (2s).
.TP
.B POLLWRNORM
Normal (band 0) data may be written to
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when band zero high water mark thresholds have
not been exceeded, or when band zero becomes back-enabled (falls below the low
water makr threshold).
.TP
.B POLLWRBAND
Priority (band > 0) data may be written to
.I fd
without blocking.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when any non-zero band high water mark
thresholds have not been exceeded, or when any non-zero band becomes
back-enabled (falls below the low water mark threshold).  This event only occurs
for bands that have been written to at least once.
.PP
In addition to the events described above, the following events can also be
indicated in the
.I revents
member:
(If these events are specified in the
.I events
member, they are ignored by
.BR poll ()).
.TP \w'POLLWRNORM\(em'u
.B POLLERR
An error has occured on the file.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message arrives at the stream head.
.TP
.B POLLHUP
A hangup has occured on the file.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
message arrives at the stream head or the stream is closing.  A stream cannot be
writable while this event is in force.
.TP
.B POLLNVAL
The corresponding
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.B POLLMSG
A pending signal has occured on the file.
For
.IR STREAMS (4)
special files, this event occurs when a
.BR M_SIG (9)
message arrives at the stream head.
.PP
.BR POLLIN ", " POLLPRI ", " POLLOUT ", " POLLRDNORM ", " POLLRDBAND ", " POLLWRNORM " and " POLLWRBAND
are only set in the
.I revents
member if they have been requested in the corresponding
.I events
member.
.BR POLLMSG ", " POLLERR ", " POLLHUP " and " POLLNVAL
are always set in the
.I revents
member if true, regardless of whether they were requested in the corresponding
.I events
member.
.\"
.\"
.PP
In each
.B pollfd
structure,
.BR poll ()
clears the
.I revents
member except that where the applicat requested a report on a condition by
setting one of the bits of
.I events
listed above,
.BR poll ()
sets the corresponding bit in
.I revents
if the requested condition is true.
In addition
.BR poll ()
sets the
.BR POLLHUP ", " POLLERR " and " POLLNVAL
flag in
.I revents
if the condition is true, even if the application did not set the corresponding
bit in
.IR events .
.PP
If none of the defined events have occured on any selected file descriptor,
.BR poll ()
waits at least
.I timeout
milliseconds for an event to occur on any of the selected file descriptors.  If
the value of
.I timeout
is zero (0),
.BR poll ()
returns immediately.  If the value of
.I timeout
is minus one (-1),
.BR poll ()
blocks until a requested event occurs or until the call is interrupted.
.PP
The
.BR poll ()
function is not affected by the
.BR O_NONBLOCK
file flag (see
.BR open (2)
or
.BR fcntl (2)).
That is,
.BR poll ()
will always block awaiting a specified event, a timeout, or interruption.
.PP
The
.BR poll ()
function supports regular files, terminal and pseudo-terminal devices,
.IR STREAMS -based
files, FIFOs and pipes.  The behavior of
.BR poll ()
on elements of
.I fds
that refer to other types of file is unspecified.
.PP
Regular files always poll true for reading and writing.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR poll ()
will return the positive number of file descriptors with returned event information.
.PP
When
.BR poll ()
times out, it will return zero (0).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR poll ()
will return -1 and set
.IR errno (3)
as described under
.IR \*(lqERRORS , \*(rq
below.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR poll ()
fails, it returns minus one (-1) and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
An invalid
.I fd
member was given in one of the
.B pollfd
structures specified by the
.I fds
argument.
This error is not specified by SUSv2

.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
There was insufficient memory to allocate file descriptor tables.
This error is not specified by SUSv2
.[
SUSv2

or POSIX (see

.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The
.I fds
argument specifies an address outside the caller's valid address range.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
A signal was caught during
.BR poll ().
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The
.I nfds
argument is greater that
.RB { NR_OPEN },
