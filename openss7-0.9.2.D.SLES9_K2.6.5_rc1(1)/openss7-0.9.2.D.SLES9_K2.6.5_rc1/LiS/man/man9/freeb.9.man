.SH NAME
.B freeb, lis_freeb
\- frees a \fISTREAMS\fR message block
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "freeb(struct msgb *" bp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I bp
the block to free.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR freeb ()
frees the message block pointed to by
.I bp
and the associated data block and data buffer.
.PP
Freeing a message block might or might not result in the deallocation of the
message block, data block or data buffer, depending upon the internal
implementation, the binding of message blocks to data blocks and whether the
buffer is an internal or external buffer.
.PP
For external data buffers that are to be freed, the
.I function
will be called with the
.I arg
provided previously to the
.BR esballoc (9)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR freeb ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If the block pointer,
.IR bp ,
passed to
.BR freeb ()
is
.BR NULL ,
then
.BR freeb ()
will silently fail.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR freeb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR freeb ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller must ensure that it has the last remaining
reference to the message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR freemsg (9)
is implemented with a looping call to
.BR freeb ().
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
uses a complicated message block and data block binding scheme with embedded
data buffers
.B FASTBUF
or less in size.  Determining the point at which a buffer is actually freed is
rather complicated.

.BR freemsg (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR freeb ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR freeb ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
and
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
