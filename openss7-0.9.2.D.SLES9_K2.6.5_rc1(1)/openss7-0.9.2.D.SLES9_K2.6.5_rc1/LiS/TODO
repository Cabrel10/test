Things to do:

The OpenSS7 release of Linux STREAMS was in maintenance mode for over a
year and the latest 2.18 releases are quite stable.  However, LiS is
fraught with bugs and suffers from a aging design approach making it
unsuitable for production use.  It fails many of the conformance test
cases in the test suite and even locks the kernel on a number of cases
on SMP kernels regardless of their being run on a UP machine.

The OpenSS7 Project wrote a new STREAMS package for Linux called Linux
Fast-STREAMS.  Linux Fast-STREAMS is now far more stable than LiS, and
The OpenSS7 Project will no longer perform develoment on the LiS
package, unless at the bequest of a project sponsor.  As such, LiS is
deprecated.  Use the latest streams package from the OpenSS7 download
site at <http://www.openss7.org/download.html> instead.

- Last remaining to do item is to release the LiS-2.18.3 release that
  might very well be the last release.
