.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int isdatamsg(mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message block to test for being of a data type.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tests whether the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
has a data block type.  Data blocks have data type when they are of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
returns true (1) if the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
is of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
returns false (0) if the data block associated with the message block pointed to by
.I mp
is not of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
is always successful.  (See
.B "\*(lqNOTICES\*(rq" ", below.)"
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR isdatamsg ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for protecting the integrity of the
message block.
