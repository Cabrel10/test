\- return the other queue of a \fISTREAMS\fR queue pair
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "queue_t *OTHERQ(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
one queue in the pair for which to return the other queue in the pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
returns the other queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the read queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is typically and often used to find the opposite queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
returns a pointer to the other queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR queue (9)
structures are always allocated in pairs as an array of two
.BR queue (9)
structure elements.  The first structure in the array is always the read queue and has
.B QREADR
set in
.IR q_flag ;
the second, the write queue, with
.B QREADR
clear.
Because of this relationship between queues in a pair,
.BR OTHERQ ()
is easily implemented as a macro as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
#define OTHERQ(q) ((q->q_flag & QREADR) ? (q+1) : (q-1))
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is
.BR NULL ,
a kernel panic (oops) will occur.

.BR WR (9),
.BR SAMESTR (9),
.BR queue (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" .
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Under many implementations,
.BR OTHERQ ()
is implemented as a macro.  Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
.BR OTHERQ ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.
.IP ""
In general, portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not be affected if any
.I STREAMS
utility is implemented as either a macro or a function.
.IP \(em
Because the size and members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure vary from implementation to implementation,
binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
