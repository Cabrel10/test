.SH NAME
.B N_CONN_CON, N_conn_con_t
\- network connection confirm
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA blocks
(for NS user data).  The specification of the NS user data is optional.
.PP
The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_CONN_CON */
    ulong RES_length;           /* responding address length */
    ulong RES_offset;           /* responding address offset */
    ulong CONN_flags;           /* bit masking for options flags */
    ulong QOS_length;           /* QOS parameters' length */
    ulong QOS_offset;           /* QOS parameters' offset */
} N_conn_con_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the source NS user that the network connect
request has been confirmed on the specified responding address.
.PP
The NS user can send any integral number of octets of NS user data within a
range supported by the NS provider (see
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)).
The NS user data will only be present if the corresponding
.BR N_CONN_RES (7)
had NS user data specified with it, and their data will always be identical.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I RES_length
Indicates the length of the responding address parameter that conveys the
network address of the NS user entity to which the NC has been established.
The semantics of the values in the
.B N_CONN_CON
is identical to the values in
.BR N_CONN_RES .
Under certain circumstances, such as call redirection, generic addressing,
etc., the value of this parameter may be different from the destination
address parameter specification in the corresponding
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7).

.TP
.I RES_offset
Indicates the offset of the responding address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I CONN_flags
Indicates the connection flags which are a bitwise OR of any of the following:
.RS

.TP
.B REC_CONF_OPT
The receipt confirmation selection parameter indicates the use/availability of
the receipt confirmation service on the NC.  The receipt confirmation service
must be provided in the network service to be used on the NC.

.TP
.B EX_DATA_OPT
The expedited data selection parameter indicatesthe use/availability of the
expedited data transfer service on the NC.  The expedited data transfer service
must be provided by the NS provider for it to be used on the NC.
.RE

.TP
.I QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values selected by the responding
NS user.  If the NS provider does not support or cannot determine the selected
value of a QOS parameter, its value will be set to
.BR QOS_UNKNOWN .
If the NS provider does not specify any QOS parameter values, the length of
this field should be set to zero.

.TP
.I QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in state
.BR NS_WCON_CREQ .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state is
.BR NS_DATA_XFER .
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
