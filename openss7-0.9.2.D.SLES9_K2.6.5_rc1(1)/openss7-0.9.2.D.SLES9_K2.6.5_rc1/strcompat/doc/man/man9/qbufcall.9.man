.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue with which to associate the timeout callback
.TP
.I size
the size of the requested data buffer.
.TP
.I priority
the priority of the requested message.  The priority can be one of the
following values:
.sp
.TS
tab(:);
lbls.
BPRI_LO:T{
the buffer requested is a low priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_MED:T{
the buffer requested is a medium priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_HI:T{
the buffer requested is a high priority buffer.
T}
BPRI_HI:T{
the buffer requested is a low priority buffer and can block.
T}
.TE
.sp
.TP
.I function
the callback function to call when a buffer of the requested size and message
of the requested priority becomes available.  This is normally the service
procedure which failed a call to
.BR allocb (9)
or it is a function pointer to
.BR qenable (9).
.TP
.I arg
the argument to pass the callback function.  This is normally a pointer to the
queue whose service procedure failed an
.BR allocb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When allocation of a buffer fails as a result of a failed call to
.BR allocb (9)
or
.BR esballoc (9)
the service routine should place the message that invoked the
.BR allocb (9)
or
.BR esballoc (9)
call back on the queue with
.BR putbq (9)
and call the
.BR qbufcall ()
function with
.BR qenable (9)
as the
.I function
argument and a pointer to the queue as the
.I arg
argument to the call.
The
.I size
and
.I priority
arguments should be the same as the
.I size
and
.I priority
arguments that were issued to
.BR allocb (9).
If
.BR esballoc (9)
failed, the
.I size
argument to
.BR qbufcall ()
should be zero (0).
.PP
In this way, the queue service routine will be recalled once there is
sufficient memory to allocate the necessary buffer and message block.
.PP
Buffer calls initiated with
.BR qbufcall ()
can be cancelled by calling
.BR qunbufcall (9)
with the returned bufcall id.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
returns a
.B bufcall_id_t
as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-2
typedef int bcid_t;
typedef int bufcall_id_t;
\s+2\fP
.fi
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qbufcall ()
returns a non-zero bufcall id and the specified
.I function
will be called with the specified
.I arg
at a later time when buffers of the necessary
.I size
become available.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR qbufcall ()
returns zero (0) and no call will be generated to the specified
.IR function .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qbufcall ()
encounters and error, it returns zero (0).
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
fails and returns zero (0) when the function pointer to the callback function,
.IR function ,
is
.BR NULL ,
or
.BR qbufcall ()
cannot allocate the necessary internal structures for the callback.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
can be called from any context including user context, queue procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Considerations should be given when writing the callback function that a
.BR qbufcall ()
callback function can execute at the same time as any non-exclusive
.BR qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR put (9)
or
.BR srv (9)
procedure,
non-exclusive
.BR qbufcall (),
or
.BR qtimeout (9)
callback or interrupt service routine.
.PP
However, the
.BR qbufcall ()
callback function will be serviced by the same CPU as the CPU from which
the
.BR qbufcall ()
was issued.  Therfore, the callback function will not execute until after
.BR qbufcall ()
returns.
Because the servicing thread and the current thread are the same, the
.BR qbufcall ()
callback will not be invoked until after the function that called
.BR qbufcall ()
returns.
This means that it is safe to store the returned bufcall id in global
variables accessed by the callback function.
It is also safe to hold private locks taken by the callback function across a
call to
.BR qbufcall (9).
This is the same situation as that of the
.BR qtimeout (9),
.BR bufcall (9)
and
.BR timeout (9)
functions.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
set.
.PP
The primary difference between
.BR qbufcall ()
and
.BR bufcall (9)
is that the
.I STREAMS
scheduler will take the same locks as a queue procedure on the associated
queue,
.IR q ,
before invoking the
.BR qbufcall ()
callback function.  No locks are taken whatsoever when scheduling a
.BR bufcall (9)
callback.
.PP
For a driver or module that has no synchronization (no perimeters or
.BR SQLVL_NONE ),
calling
.BR qbufcall ()
has the same effect as calling
.BR bufcall (9).
.PP
.B bufcall_id_t
should be treated as an opaque type that can be tested for equality to zero.
The value should not otherwise be manipulated.
Although
.B bufcall_id_t
has traditionally been implemented as an integer index,
.BR qbufcall ()
implements bufcall id values internally as out-dating pointer into a
.B strevent
structure.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qbufcall ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
and
.IR LiS ,
do not provide this function.
.IP \(em
.BR qbufcall()
passed a
.B NULL
.I q
pointer has the same effect as
.BR bufcall (9).
.IP \(em
.BR qbufcall ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR bufcall (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR qbufcall ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR qbufcall ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR qbufcall ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

.BR suncompat (9)
