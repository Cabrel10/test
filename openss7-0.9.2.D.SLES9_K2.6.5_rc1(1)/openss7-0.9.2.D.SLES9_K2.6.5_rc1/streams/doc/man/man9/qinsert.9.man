.SH NAME
.B qinsert
\- insert a queue pair beneath another queue pair in a stream
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "void qinsert(queue_t *" brq ", " queue_t *" irq );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I brq
the queue pair beneath which to insert.
.PD 0
.TP
.I irq
the queue pair to insert.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
inserts the queue pair indicated by the read queue pointer
.I irq
beneath the queue pair indicated by the read queue pointer
.IR brq .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
is not intended to be called by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
should only be called from the
.BR qattach (9)
procedure or a Stream head
.BR stropen (9)
close procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
should only be called from user context or from within a
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Calling
.BR qinsert ()
with invalid read pointer
.IR brq " or " irq
will have undefined result.
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
only peforms half of the steps required to fully insert a queue pair within a
stream. The other half of the insert must be performed by calling
.BR qprocson (9)
for the inserted queue pair.
.PP
The inserted queue pair,
.IR irq ,
will inherit the same stream head reference as that of
.IR brq .

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
is compatible with descriptions of
.I STREAMS
internals for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
magic
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qinsert ()
is roughly compatible with the internal operations described for
.IR "SVR 4 STREAMS"
in
.RI \(lq "The Magic Garden Explained" \(rq.
.[
magic
.]
.IP ""
.BR qinsert ()
is an internal function that will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.IP \(em
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and systems based on
.I SVR 4
do not export this function.
.IP \(em
Source and Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
.BR qinsert ()
is consistent with the description of the internal
.BR qattach (9)
function of
.I SVR 4
.[

as described in
.IR "\*(lqThe Magic Garden\*(rq" .
