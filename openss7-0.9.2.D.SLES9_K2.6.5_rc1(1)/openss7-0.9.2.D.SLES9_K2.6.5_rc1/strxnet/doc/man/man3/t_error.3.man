.TH T_ERROR 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B t_error
\- print an error message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void t_error(char *" errmsg );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I errmsg
the error message to print.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_error ()
produces a message on
.B stderr
describing
the last error encountered during an XTI/TLI Library function call.  The argument
string
.I errmsg
is printed first, then a colon and a blank, then the message and a new-line.
To be of most use, the argument string should include the name of the function
that incurred the error.  The XTI/TLI error number is taken from the external
variable
.IR t_errno (3),
which is set to when errors occur but not cleared when non-erroneous calls are
made.
.PP
.BR t_strerror (3)
can be used to obtain the error string associated with
.IR t_errno (3)
without printing the string.
.PP
When an XTI/TLI Library call fails, it usually returns -1 and sets the variable
.IR t_errno (3)
to a value describing what went wrong.
.BR t_error ()
serves to translate this error code into a human-readible form.  Note that
.IR t_errno (3)
is undefined after a successful XTI/TLI library call: a call may change the valud
of
.IR t_errno (3)
even though it succeeds, perhaps because it is set by an internal XTI/TLI library
call that failed.
.PP
.I errmsg
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.BR t_error ()
returns
.BR void .
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR t_error ()
always succeeds.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR t_errno (3),
.BR t_strerror (3).
.\"

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
.BR t_error ()
has no known bugs.
.BR t_error ()
has been tested for the described behavior using the
.BR test-xnet (8)
and
.BR test-xnet_thr (8)
conformance test suites.
