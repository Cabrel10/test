The

message block is a

structure and associated data buffer that contains structured data.
.PP
An
.B M_READ
message is a high priority message that consists of a single
.B M_READ
message block.
.PP
The
.B M_READ
message block contains a single
.B unsigned long
value reflecting the

argument to the
.BR read (2s)
system call.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_READ
message, (when requested using the
.B SO_MREADON
flag in a
.BR M_SETOPTS (9)
message to the
Stream head),
is generated by the
Stream head
just prior to blocking a process calling
.BR read (2s),
.BR getmsg (2),
or
.BR getpmsg (2s)
that has opened the
Stream
for blocking operation (i.e., neither
.B O_NONBLOCK
nor
.B O_NDELAY
flags are set with
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR fcntl (2))
due to an empty read queue at the
Stream head.
.PP
By default,
Stream heads
do no generate
.B M_READ
messages: the
.B SO_MREADON
flag in the
.I so_flags
field of an
.BR M_SETOPTS (9)
message must be sent to the
Stream head
by a driver or module to enable the generation of
.B M_READ
messages.
Generation of
.B M_READ
messages can be disabled again using the
.B SO_MREADOFF
flag.
.PP
The format of the
.B M_READ
message is a single
.B M_READ
message block containing the
.B unsigned long
value of the
.I nbyte
argument to the
.BR read (2s)
system call that generated the
.B M_READ
message.
For the
.BR getmsg (2)
or
.BR getpmsg (2)
system calls where the data part is being retrieved, the
.B unsigned long
value in the
.B M_READ
message corresponds to the
.I maxlen
member of the
.BR strbuf (5)
structure to which a pointer is passed in the
.I datap
argument to the
.BR getmsg (2)
or
.BR getpmsg (2s)
call.
.PP
.B M_READ
messages, when enabled, notify drivers and modules of the occurence of a read that blocks.  It is
also intended to support communication between
Streams
that are hosted on separate processors.
.PP
The use of the resulting
.B M_READ
messages by drivers and modules is developer dependent.  When processed, treatment of
.B M_READ
messages form part of the specification of the service interface.
.\"
.PP
.B M_READ
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process (but indirectly by performing a read
operation).
.B M_READ
messages arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_READ
messages should not be generated by drivers or modules.
.B M_READ
messages are consumed by the driver or module responding to them.

.SH USAGE
.PP
For a
.IR STREAMS -based
terminal in canonical mode, if the
.B ICANON
flag is on in
.IR c_lflag ,
canonical processing is performed.  If the
.B ICANON
flag is off, non-canonical processing is performed (see
.BR termios (7)
for more details).  Handling of
.BR VMIN / VTIME
in the
.I STREAMS
environment is somewhat complicated, because
.BR read (2s)
needs to activate a timer in the
.BR ldterm (4)
module in some cases; hence, read notification becomes necessary.
When a user issues an
.BR ioctl (2s)
to put
.BR ldterm (4)
in non-canonical (raw) mode,
the
.BR ldterm (4)
module sends an
.BR M_SETOPTS (9)
message to the Stream head to register read notification.  Further reads on the terminal file
descriptor will cause the Stream head to issue an
.B M_READ
message downstream and data will be sent upstream in response to the
.B M_READ
message.  With read notification, buffering of raw data is performed by
.BR ldterm (4).
It is possible to canonize the raw data, when the user has switched from raw to canonical mode.
However, the reverse is not possible.
.PP
To summarize, in non-canonical mode, the
.BR ldterm (4)
module buffers all data until a request for the data arrives in the form of an
.B M_READ
message.  The number of bytes sent upstream will be the argument of the
.B M_READ
message.
If the number is
.B FASTBUF
or less, the
.B M_READ
message can trasformed into an
.BR M_DATA (9)
message to pass the data.
.PP
The following guidelines are for processing of the
.B M_READ
message at drivers and modules:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
If an intermediate module recognizes, but is not processing the
.B M_READ
message, it passes it downstream.  As a high priority message, the
.B M_READ
message is not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module does not recognize the
.B M_READ
message, it passes it upstream or downstream as with any unrecognized high priority message: it is
not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
If a driver receives an
.B M_READ
message and does not recognize the message, it is discarded.  If the driver is not processing
read notifications, the message is discarded.
.IP \(bu
If an intermediate module or the driver recognizes the
.B M_READ
message and is processing the message, it treats the message as an indication that a read attempt
has been made that is blocked at the
Stream head
and consumes the message.
