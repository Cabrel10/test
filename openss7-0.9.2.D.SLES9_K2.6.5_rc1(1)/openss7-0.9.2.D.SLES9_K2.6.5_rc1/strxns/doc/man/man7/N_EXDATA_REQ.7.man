.TH N_EXDATA_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Network Provider Interface (NPI)"
.SH NAME
.B N_EXDATA_REQ, N_exdata_req_t
\- expedited data transfer request
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a NS user originated primitive and is used to indicate to the network
provider that the message block contains an ENSDU.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
blocks.  The NS user must send an integral number of octets of data within the
range supported by the NS provider (see
.BR N_INFO_ACK(7)).
The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_EXDATA_REQ */
} N_exdata_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in state
.BR NS_DATA_XFER .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state remains the same
.RB ( NS_DATA_XFER ).
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive does not require any acknowledgemnts, although it may generate
a fatal (unrecoverable) error.  This is indicated via an
.B M_ERROR
.I STREAMS
message type (issued to the NS user with the
.IR errno (3)
value of
.BR EPROTO ),
which results in the failure of all system calls on that stream.
.SH ERRORS
The applicable errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.IP \- 4
The network interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
.IP \-
The amount of NS user data associated with the primitive defines an expedited
network service data unit of a size that is outside the range supported by the
NS provider.
.IP \-
Expedited data transfer is either not supported by the NS provider or not
requested with the
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7) 
primitive.
.PP
.B Note:
If the interface is in the
.B NS_IDLE
or
.B NS_WRES_RIND
states when the provider receives the
.B N_EXDATA_REQ
primitive, then the NS provider should discard the request without generating
a fatal error.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
