Things to do:

- I want to write a NetFilter pseudo-device driver that will install and
  control netfilter hooks for performance testing.  It will do things
  like packet drops, checksum errors, packet duplication, packet delay,
  and combinations, for a specified range of addresses and/or protocols.
  Also a set of user-space utilities (C language programs) to permit the
  control of the filters.  The purpose is to be able to do a wide range
  of performance testing on simulated networks that are simply loopback
  devices.  This would permit performance test programs (such as
  netperf) to be used for testing special network conditions on SCTP
  (for example), and will also allow for comparison tests.

* The strxns package contains several GPL'd modules and drivers
  originally included in the LiS releases that were removed to this
  package so that they could be used with both LiS and Linux
  Fast-STREAMS.

- Test.  Almost none of the modules or drivers in this package have been
  tested throuroughly against either LiS or Linux Fast-STREAMS.  One of
  the primary reasons for this is that The OpenSS7 Project does not
  really use any of these modules or drivers.

- Write an NPI interface driver to the Linux IP subsystem.  That is, the
  rough NPI equivalent of a raw IP TPI Stream.

  The purpose of this driver is twofold:

  1.  The OpenSS7 Project has need for a RTP (Real-Time Transport
      Protocol) and, because RTP runs over UDP, it is necessary to
      intercept packets ahead of UDP at the IP level to avoid opening
      Sockets from inside the kernel.  This NPI IP driver would
      accomplish that feat.  This would also permit 1 Stream to be
      opened but which communicates on many RTP channels.

  2.  The OpenSS7 Project has a need for direct interface and
      interception (drop and insert) capabilities at the IP level for
      the purposes of testing both RTP and SCTP.  This later purpose is
      less critical because Ferry-Clip testing can be rigged to RTP and
      SCTP to acheive the same effect.

  3.  Although the STREAMS SCTP driver directly interfaces with the IP
      subsystem at the driver-kernel interface, it might be of some
      advantage to make SCTP a pushable module that simply pushes over
      one of these NPI IP Streams.  The ability to bind to multiple
      addresses and multiple protocols would be of use to SCTP.

  4.  If we can find some sort of standardized interface semantics
      (perhaps by examining OpenSolaris), it might be possible to make
      many of The OpenSS7 Project drivers, such as RTP and SCTP
      immediately portable to other operating systems with STREAMS such
      as Solaris, pSOS, VxWorks, LynxOS, etc.  (Errr... no.  After
      examining OpenSolaris IP code, it is so messed up that there is no
      good way to interface to it except at the kernel level.  However,
      the approach might still be valid for portability because the
      Operating System dependent procedures could be encapsultated in
      the NPI IP driver and then only the NPI IP driver needs to be
      ported, and not the other upper-layer protocols.  Yes, the
      approach still has some validity.)

  *done*

    The np_ip driver performs many of these functions now.  Test suites
    for the driver are also provided.

- This might be a useful place to drop all of the DLPI drivers from the
  strss7 package, particularly those for X.25, Frame Relay, and ISDN
  LAPD and LAPB.
