.SH NAME
.B M_EVENT
\- \fISTREAMS\fP event message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_EVENT
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains structured data.  The
.B M_EVENT
data buffer contains an
.B str_evmsg
structure.
.PP
An
.B M_EVENT
message is a normal priority message that consists of one
.B M_EVENT
message block.
.\"

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_EVENT
(and
.BR M_PCEVENT (9))
messages are generated by a driver or module and sent upstream to the
Stream head
to cause an event to be posted to the obsolete
.IR "General Events Subsystem" .
.PP
The format of the
.B M_EVENT
message is one
.B M_EVENT
message block containing an
.BR str_evmsg (9)
structure formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct str_evmsg {
    long sv_event;     /* module-specific event */
    vnode_t *sv_vp;    /* vnode pointer of event queue */
    long sv_eid;       /* event id */
    long sv_evpri;     /* event priority */
    long sv_flags;     /* event flags */
    uid_t sv_uid;      /* user id of posting process */
    pid_t sv_pid;      /* process id of posting process */
    hostid_t sv_hostid; /* host id of posting process */
    long sv_pad[4];    /* reserved */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
where,
.TP \w'sv_hostid\(em'u
.I sv_event
is a module-specific value that specifies the event to be posted.
.PD 0
.TP
.I sv_vp
is the vnode pointer of the event queue to which to post.
.TP
.I sv_eid
is the event identifier.
.TP
.I sv_evpri
is the even priority.
.TP
.I sv_flags
are event flags.
.TP
.I sv_uid
is the user id of the posting process, if any.
.TP
.I sv_pid
is the process id of the posting process, if any.
.TP
.I sv_hostid
is the host id  of the posting process.
.PD
.\"
.PP
.B M_EVENT 
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_EVENT
messages arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_EVENT
messages arriving at a non-multiplexing driver can be discarded (ignored and freed).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B M_EVENT
message is long obsolete.  No
.I General Event Subsystem
exists anymore.
The
.B M_EVENT
message type is retained only as a placeholder.
If an
.B M_EVENT
message is received by the
Stream head,
it will be discarded.
.PP
Modules and drivers receiving this message should treat it as any other unknown message type: that
is:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules receiving the
.B M_EVENT
message in either direction should pass the message along.
Because the
.B M_EVENT
message is a normal priority message, consideration must be given to flow control and message
ordering when passing the message.
.IP \(bu
Drivers receiving the
.B M_EVENT
message will discard the message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B M_EVENT
message is long obsolete.  No
.I General Event Subsystem
exists anymore.

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_EVENT
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Only
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
documents the
.BR M_EVENT " and " M_PCEVENT (9)
data block types.
These data block types are provided for source compatibility with drivers
written for
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
It might be necessary to define
.B _SUN_SOURCE
before including
.B sys/stream.h
to expose these symbols.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.BR M_EVENT " and " M_PCEVENT (9)
data block types.
.IP \(em
The
.B M_EVENT
message is specific to early
.IR Solaris \(rg
implementations before
.IR Solaris \(rg " 2.4" .
Little to no documentation exists on its previous use.
The constant
.B M_EVENT
is retained as a placeholder.
.IP ""
This message will not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibiltiy is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
