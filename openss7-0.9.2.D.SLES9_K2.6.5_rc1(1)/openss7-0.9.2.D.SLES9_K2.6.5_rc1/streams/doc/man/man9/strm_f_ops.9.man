.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B strm_f_ops
provides access to the Stream head file operations structure for use by specialized drivers
.RB ( clone "(4), " nsdev (4))
that need to perform registrations on behalf of drivers using the Stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B strm_f_ops
is not intended for direct use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
It is used by the
.B clone (4)
driver to register itself as a specialized driver and to provide the
.BR register_strdev (9)
and
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
registration functions.
