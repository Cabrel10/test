/* I don't know if it's a good idea to keep the strinfo structs around

 * completelly the STREAMS memory management. 
 * I guess it would be better just to alloc raw memory pages and avoid 
 * memory fragmentation by using the knowledge of what's likely to be requested
 * what's likely to be freed and what the sizes are.
 * When one of those pages get w/ count 0 (i.e., no used chunk inside) we could
 * just give it back to the kernel.
 * More on, we could keep initialized structs in a pre-initialized state, so
 * only the very first time they're use they're filled. Later on, the initial
 * initialization process could be skipped.
 * There was an article in UNSENIX (don't remember exactly where) about this.
