.SH NAME
.B t_rcv
\- received transport data
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcv(int " fd ", char *" buf ", unsigned int " nbytes ", int *" flags );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to receive data.
.TP
.I buf
a pointer to a buffer to contain the received data.
.TP
.I nbytes
the maximum number of bytes in the caller supplied buffer.
.TP
.I flags
a pointer to an
.B int
to contain the returned data flags.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcv ()
receives connection oriented transport data arriving on the local transport
endpoint identified by
.I fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which the connection oriented data
is expected to arrive.
.PP
.I buf
points to a buffer to contain the received data on return.
.PP
.I nbytes
specifies the size of the buffer
.IR buf .
.PP
.I flags
provides information about the received data on return.  Flags returned by
.BR t_rcv ()
can be a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
indicates on return that a subsequent receive operation is necessary to
receive the remainder of the data belonging to the same transport service data
unit.
.TP
.B T_EXPEDITED
indicates on return that the received data was expedited data.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcv ()
is only valid in the
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_OUTREL
states.
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcv ()
will block awaiting the arrival of data or an asynchronous event.  In
asynchronous mode,
.BR t_rcv ()
if there is no data immediately available,
.BR t_rcv ()
will fail, return -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNODATA .
.PP
Portions of a transport service data unit can be interleaved with portions of
an expedited transport service data unit.
.PP
If the
.I tsdu
field of the
.B t_info
structure returned by
.BR t_open "(3) or " t_getinfo (3)
is
.BR T_INVALID ,
then the flag
.B T_MORE
has no meaning for normal data received with
.BR t_rcv ().
If the
.I etsdu
field of the
.B t_info
structure returned by
.BR t_open "(3) or " t_getinfo (3)
is
.BR T_INVALID ,
then the flag
.B T_MORE
has no meaning for expedited data received with
.BR t_rcv ().
.PP
.BR t_rcv ()
is functionally equivalent to
.BR read (2),
and the two functions can be used interchangeably; however,
.BR read (2)
does not maintain
.IR t_errno (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcv ()
returns zero (0) or a positive integer indicating the number of bytes that was
received and placed in the caller supplied buffer
.IR buf .
In addition, on success,
.BR t_rcv ()
returns flags associated with the received data in the area pointed to by
.IR flags .
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcv ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcv ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See \fBt_look\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
