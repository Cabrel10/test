5.4.3 Beta Releases
-------------------

"Beta" releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing
to date is not exhaustive.  "Beta" release packages do not ship with known
defects.  All known defects are respolved before distribution; however, as
exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown defects may exist.  The
purpose for a "beta" release is to provide a baseline for other organizations
to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

"Beta" release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been
exhaustively tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.
Suitability of software in this category for production use is not advised by
the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the user of the
software.
