.SH NAME
.B M_HANGUP
\- \fISTREAMS\fP hangup message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_HANGUP
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains no data.
.PP
An
.B M_HANGUP
message is a high priority message that consists of a single
.B M_HANGUP
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_HANGUP
message is generated and sent upstream by a driver or module to report that it can no longer send
data upstream.  As an example, this might be due to an error, or to a remote line connection being
dropped.
.PP
When the message reaches the
Stream head,
the
Stream
is marked so that all subsequent
.BR write (2s),
.BR putmsg (2),
.BR putpmsg (2s),
and write-related
system calls issued to the
Stream
will fail and return
.RB [ ENXIO ]
error.  Those
.BR ioctl (2s)s
that cause messages to be sent downstream or otherwise affect he sending of messages downstream are
also failed.
.B POLLHUP
is set if the
Stream
is being polled [see
.BR poll (2s)].
For a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
.RB [ EPIPE ]
is returned instead of
.RB [ ENXIO ]
and a
.RI { SIGPIPE }
signal is sent to the writing process.
For a
.IR STREAMS -based
controlling terminal,
.RB [ ENXIO ]
is returned,
and a
.RI { SIGHUP }
signal is sent to the controlling process.  The signal is sent to the controlling process instead of
the foreground process group, since the allocation and deallocation of controlling terminals to a
session is the responsibility of the controlling process.
Any process that has registered for a
.B S_HANGUP
event for the
Stream
will have a
.RI { SIGPOLL }
signal sent.
.PP
However, subsequent
.BR read (2s),
.BR getmsg (2),
.BR getpmsg (2s),
and read-related
system calls issued to the
Stream
will not generate an error.  These calls will return any messages (according to their function) that
were on, or in transit to, the
Stream head
read queue before the
.B M_HANGUP
message was received.  When all such messages have been read,
.BR read (2s)
will return zero
.RB ( 0 )
and
.BR getmsg (2)
will set each of its two length fields to zero
.RB ( 0 )
to indicate terminal hangup.  (Note that, in constrast, a terminal end-of-file is indicated by
setting the control part length to minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and the data part length to zero
.RB ( 0 ).)
.PP
Any process attempting to open a hungup
Stream,
with the
.BR open (2s)
system call,
will fail and the caller will be returned the error number
.RB [ EIO ]
in
.IR errno (3).
.PP
A hangup condition induced at the
Stream head
by sending an
.B M_HANGUP
message can be reversed under some implementataions with the non-portable
.BR M_UNHANGUP (9)
message.
See
.BR M_UNHANGUP (9)
for details.
.\"
.PP
.B M_HANGUP
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process, except by closing one side of a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
or the slave side of a
.IR STREAMS -based
pseudo-terminal.
.B M_HANGUP
messages arriving at a non-multiplexing drivers should be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_HANGUP
messages can be generated by drivers and modules.
.B M_HANGUP
messages arriving at the
Stream head
are consumed.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B M_HANGUP
message is used normally for terminals and terminal-like interfaces that use primarly the
.BR read (2s)
and
.BR write (2s)
system calls for IO to the driver.
.PP
An example of such a terminal-like interface is the
.BR tirdwr (4)
module that converts a
.I "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)"
networking Stream to provide support to a primarily terminal-like
.BR read (2s)/ write " (2s)
interface.
See
.BR tirdwr (4)
for details.
.PP
The
.B M_HANGUP
message can be used in much the same circumstances an an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message.  Indeed, the differences between an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message with only a write-side error of
.RB [ ENXIO ]
are slight.
(Such an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
will generate an
.B S_ERROR
event instead of
.B S_HANGUP
and
.B POLLERR
will be reported instead of
.BR POLLHUP .)
.PP
The following guidelines provide best practise for generation of the
.B M_HANGUP
message for drivers and modules:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The
.B M_HANGUP
message is a high priority message and is not subjected to flow control.  Modules should pass the
.B M_HANGUP
message along directly from a
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure and should not queue the message.
.IP \(bu
Modules and driver should only pass this message upstream.  Intermediate modules may record the fact
that a
.B M_HANGUP
message has transitted the module; however, the
module must pass the
.B M_HANGUP
message along upstream.
.IP \(bu
An
.B M_HANGUP
message arriving at the write-side queue of a module should be passed along as an unrecognized
message type.
This permits
.B M_HANGUP
messages to be passed along a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4).
.IP \(bu
An
.B M_HANGUP
message arriving at the write-side queue of a driver should be discarded.
.IP \(bu
An
.B M_HANGUP
message arriving at the read-side queue on the lower side of a multiplexing driver should be
treated in a similar fashion as the
Stream head.
That is, the driver should cease sending messages
on the lower multiplexer queue pair.
.IP \(bu
Because of the asynchronous nature of the
.B M_HANGUP
message, use of the
.B M_HANGUP
message by a driver or module should be reserved for disconnect conditions, where the
Stream
is unusable for transmission and will require the
Stream
to be dismantled and recreated to reestablish communications.  Non-disconnect conditions should be
reported with the protocol of the service interface, or using the
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message.
.IP \(bu
Fatal protocol errors are to be reported with the
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message and not with the
.B M_HANGUP
message.
.IP \(bu
.B M_HANGUP
should not be used to return an error to an
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
Unless a hangup condition has truly occured, an
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message should be used instead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_HANGUP
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
There are no portability issues with the
.B M_HANGUP
message.
.IP \(em
.B M_HANGUP
