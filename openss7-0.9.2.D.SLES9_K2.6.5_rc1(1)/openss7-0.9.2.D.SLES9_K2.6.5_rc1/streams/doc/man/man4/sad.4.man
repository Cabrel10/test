.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I fd
is a file descriptor returned from an
.BR open (2s)
system call on one of the following devices:
.TP
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
This device is only accessible by privileged users.
.TP
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/user \*(rq
This device is accessible by all users.
.\"

using the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call as follows:

.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", int " cmd ", int" arg );
.TP
.I fd

.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
or
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/user \*(rq
device.
.TP
.I cmd
is the ioctl command and can be one of the following:
.sp
.TS
tab(;);
lbw(12)lsss.
SAD_GAP;get autopush list.
SAD_SAP;set autopush list or clone minor.
SAD_VML;verify module list.
.TE
.TP
.I arg
is a pointer to a

.IR cmd .
.PP
Each
.I cmd
is described in the subsections which follow:
.\"

Historically, the

driver has not used user credentials on a IO control by IO control basis, but
permits access to the privileged
.B SAD_SAP
command on the basis of file access controls.  This means that a user program
can open the
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
device while suid root and then downgrade its credentials for security, but
still have the ability to modify the autopush list for
.IR STREAMS (4)
