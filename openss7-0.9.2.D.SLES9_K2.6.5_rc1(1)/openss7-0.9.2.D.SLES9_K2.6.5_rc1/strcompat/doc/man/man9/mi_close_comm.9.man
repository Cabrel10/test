.SH NAME
.B mi_close_comm
\- \fISTREAMS\fP common minor device close utility
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _AIX_SOURCE
.br
.B #define _MAC_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
int \fBmi_close_comm\fR(caddr_t *\fIstatep\fR, queue_t *\fIq\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I statep
Specifies the address of a static pointer which will be used internally by
.BR mi_open_comm (0)
to store the address of the module's list of open streams.
.TP
.I q
A pointer to the module or driver's read queue,
obtained directly from
.BR qclose (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
performs housekeeping during
.I STREAMS
driver or module close operations.
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is intended to be called by the driver or module
.BR qclose (9)
procedure.  It releases memory allocated by a previous
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
call, and frees the minor number for reuse.
.PP
If an
.BR mi_bufcall (9)
operation is outstanding, module resources are not freed until the
.BR mi_bufcall (9)
operation is complete.
.PP
Each call to
.BR mi_close_comm ()
must have a previous corresponding call to
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
always returns zero (0).
If the last module was closed and freed using
.BR mi_close_comm ()
then the pointer pointed to by
.I statep
will contain
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR mi_close_comm ()
fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
can be called from User Context.
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is normally called from within a
.I STREAMS
module's
.BR qclose (9)
procedure (User Context).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is a
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
and
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Following is an example of a module
.BR qclose (9)
procedure using
.BR mi_close_comm ():
(See also the example for
.BR mi_open_comm (9).)

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
and
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and it should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.IP \(em
Use of
.BR mi_close_comm ()
requires different include file sequences on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
than on
.IR AIX \(rg
or
.IR MacOT \(rg.
.IR AIX \(rg
includes
.B <pse/mi.h>
and
.B <sys/stream.h>
only.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_close_comm ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_close_comm ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR AIX \(rg
and
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_close_comm ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
