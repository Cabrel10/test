.B #include <sys/ddi.h>

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I flag
An allocation flag according to
.BR kmem_alloc (9).
This flag can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP \w'KM_NOSLEEP\(em'u
.B KM_SLEEP
The caller can sleep awaiting allocation.
.PD 0
.TP
.B KM_NOSLEEP
The caller cannot sleep awaiting allocation.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC "(), " ATOMIC_INT_DEALLOC "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_INIT (9),
.BR ATOMIC_INT_READ "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_WRITE "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_ADD (9),
.BR ATOMIC_INT_SUB "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_INCR "(9) and " ATOMIC_INT_DECR (9)
are a set of functions used to allocate, deallocate, initialize, read from,
write to, add to, subtract from, increment or decrement an integer value in an
atomic fashion.  These functions operate on the
.B atomic_int_t
which is an opaque type representing an integer that is manipulated in an
atomic fashion by these functions.
.\"
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
allocates an atomic integer and returns a pointer to the allocated
.B atomic_int_t
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
returns a pointer to the
.I atomic_int_t
counter that was allocated when
.I flag
is
.BR KM_SLEEP
or
.I flag
is
.BR KM_NOSLEEP
and the allocation was successful.  Otherwise, if
.I flag
is
.B KM_NOSLEEP
and the allocation was unsuccessful,
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the
.I flag
argument is
.B KM_NOSLEEP
and
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
fails to allocate an
.BR atomic_int_t ,
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
can be called from any context with the
.B KM_NOSLEEP
flag.  With the
.B KM_SLEEP
flag, it may only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
is MP-safe when called in the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
calls
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
with the supplied
.I flag
to allocate sufficient memory for the atomic type and then initializes the
atomic integer to zero.
.\"
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
