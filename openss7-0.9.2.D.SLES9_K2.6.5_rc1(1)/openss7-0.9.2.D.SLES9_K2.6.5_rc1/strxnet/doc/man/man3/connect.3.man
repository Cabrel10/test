.SH NAME
.B connect
\- connect a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int connect(int " socket ", const struct sockaddr *" address ", socklen_t " address_len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR connect ()
function requests a connection to be made on a socket.
The function takes the following arguments:
.TP
.I socket
Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket.
.TP
.I address
Points to a
.B sockaddr
structure containing the peer address.  The length and
format of the address depend on the address family of the socket.
.TP
.I address_len
Specifies the length of the
.B sockaddr
structure pointed to by the address
argument.
.PP
If the socket has not already been bound to a local address,
.BR connect ()
will bind it to an address which, unless the socket's address family is
.BR AF_UNIX ,
is an unused local address.
.PP
If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then
.BR connect ()
sets the
socket's peer address, but no connection is made.  For
.B SOCK_DGRAM
sockets,
the peer address identifies where all datagrams are sent on subsequent
.BR send (3)
calls, and limits the remote sender for subsequent
.BR recv (3)
calls.  If address is a null address for the protocol, the socket's peer
address will be reset.
.PP
If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then
.BR connect ()
attempts
to establish a connection to the address specified by the address argument.
.PP
If the connection cannot be established immediately and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is not
set for the file descriptor for the socket,
.BR connect ()
will block for up to
an unspecified timeout interval until the connection is established.  If
the timeout interval expires before the connection is established,
.BR connect ()
will fail and the connection attempt will be aborted.  If
.BR connect ()
is interrupted by a signal that is caught while blocked
waiting to establish a connection,
.BR connect ()
will fail and set
.IR errno (3)
to
.RB [ EINTR ],
but the connection request will not be aborted, and the connection
will be established asynchronously.
.PP
If the connection cannot be established immediately and
.B O_NONBLOCK
is set
for the file descriptor for the socket,
.BR connect ()
will fail and set
.IR errno (3)
to
.RB [ EINPROGRESS ],
but the connection request will not be aborted, and the
connection will be established asynchronously.  Subsequent calls to
.BR connect ()
for the same socket, before the connection is established, will
fail and set
.IR errno (3)
to
.RB [ EALREADY ].
.PP
When the connection has been established asynchronously,
.BR select (2)
and
.BR poll (2)
will indicate that the file descriptor for the
socket is ready for writing.
.PP
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges
to use the
.BR connect ()
function.
.SH NOTES
.PP
If
.BR connect ()
fails, the state of the socket is unspecified.  Portable
applications should close the file descriptor and create a new socket before
attempting to reconnect.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR connect ()
returns 0.  Otherwise, -1 is returned
and
.IR errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR connect ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EADDRNOTAVAIL ]
The specified address is not available from the local machine.
.TP
.RB [ EAFNOSUPPORT ]
The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of the
specified socket.
.TP
.RB [ EALREADY ]
A connection request is already in progress for the specified socket.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ ECONNREFUSED ]
The target address was not listening for connections or refused the connection
request.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
The address parameter can not be accessed.
.TP
.RB [ EINPROGRESS ]
.B O_NONBLOCK
is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the
connection cannot be immediately established; the connection will be
established asynchronously.
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by delivery of
a signal that was caught; the connection will be established asynchronously.
.TP
.RB [ EISCONN ]
The specified socket is connection-mode and is already connected.
.TP
.RB [ ENETUNREACH ]
No route to the network is present.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSOCK ]
The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTOTYPE ]
The specified address has a different type than the socket bound to the
specified peer address.
.TP
.RB [ ETIMEDOUT ]
The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.
.PP
If the address family of the socket is
.BR AF_UNIX ,
then
.BR connect ()
will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.TP
.RB [ ELOOP ]
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname in
address.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
pathname exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.
.TP
.RB [ ENOENT ]
A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the pathname
is an empty string.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
A component of the path prefix of the pathname in address is not a
directory.
.PP
The
.BR connect ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix; or write
access to the named socket is denied.
.TP
.RB [ EADDRINUSE ]
Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that are already in
use.
.TP
.RB [ ECONNRESET ]
Remote host reset the connection request.
.TP
.RB [ EHOSTUNREACH ]
The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host is down
or a remote router cannot reach it).
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The address_len argument is not a valid length for the address family; or
invalid address family in
.B sockaddr
structure.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
.TP
.RB [ ENETDOWN ]
The local interface used to reach the destination is down.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
No buffer space is available.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient STREAMS resources available to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The socket is listening and can not be connected.
