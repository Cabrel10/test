.SH NAME
.B qcountstrm
\- add all counts on all \fISTREAMS\fR message queues in a stream
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "ssize_t qcountstrm(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to begin summing queue counts.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
sums all of the
.I q->q_count
counts for each queue downstream of the specified queue,
.IR q .
Only queues that are in the same stream as the specified queue,
.IR q ,
will be counted.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
returns the sum of all the queue counts
.RI ( q->q_count )
in the queues downstream of the specified queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for the validity of the passed in
.I q
pointer across the call.
.PP
The validity of either queue in the pair, and either
.I q_next
pointer for a queue in the pair, for the queue pointer passed to a module
procedure, callout or synchronous callback functions, is guaranteed by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
Any queue pointer in the pair passed as an argument to an asynchronous callback
function are also valid, providing the driver or module observes the rules for
cancellation of asynchronous callbacks on close.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
also provides that a queue pointer in the pair within whose procedures an
asynchronous callback was invoked, and either
.I q_next
pointer, are also valid in an asynchronous callback.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qcountstrm ()
is compatible with
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
keeps track of message block sizes in
.I q->q_count
for a queue.
.I LiS
counts the absolute sizes of data blocks.  This is an
.I LiS
bug.  See
.BR msgsize (9).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
instead of
.IR LiS .
