@chapter TPI-TCAP

A document describing using XTI and mOSI for TCAP has been generated to support the use of the
OpenSS7 TCAP TRI (Transaction Interface) using the methods of the X/Open minmal OSI interface
described in XNS 5.2.  This document describes a corrigendum to the X/Open TPI Revision 2.0.0 that
describes this TCAP transport provider that supports TCAP to XTI using the X/Open Transport Provider
Interface.  No new primitive or semantics have been added to the interface, merely a definition of
the protocol-specific and provider-specific aspects of TCAP Transport.

TCAP Transport is very close to the XTI mOSI transport specification.  The major difference is that
SCCP Network Layer Addresses and options are used instead of ISO Presentation Layer addresses and
options.  Aside from that, TCAP Transport resembles X.217 (ACSE) ISO/OSI Presentation.

@section Addressing

TPI-TCAP uses SCCP formatted addresses instead of ISO Presentation Layer addresses.

@subsection Address Format

The address format for a TCAP address is as follows:

@section Options

@subsection TCAP Level Options

@subsubsection Application Context Name

@subsubsection User Information

@subsection SCCP Level Options

@unnumberedsubsubsec SCCP Quality of Service Options

The TCAP interface uses protocol level T_SS7_SCCP for options at the SCCP level.  SCCP QOS
parameters are communicated to the underlying transport using the option name T_SCCP_QOS.  There are
three QOS structures which can be used in this fashion are listed in @emph{Table 7} as follows:

@image{tpi_tabx} @center Table 7@strong{@emph{.  SCCP QOS Option Values}}

Quality of service structure @code{N_qos_sel_sccp_t} has the following fields:

@table @emph
@item n_qos_type
This is the NPI Quality of Service structure type and is always set to
@code{N_QOS_SEL_SCCP}, @code{N_QOS_OPT_SEL_SCCP}, or @code{N_QOS_RANGE_SCCP}.
@item protocol_class
This is the protocol class.  The @emph{protocol_class} field can be one of the following:
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} (SCCP connectionless protocol class 0),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_1} (for SCCP connectionless protocol class 1),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 2),
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 3) or
@code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} and @code{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} are not applicable to TCAP.
@item option_flags
If the @emph{options_flags} field has bit @code{N_QOS_OPT_RETERR} set then the SCCP will return the
PDU on error.
@item importance
This is the importance of the message for consideration for SCCP flow control.  This value is not
normally set by the user.  It can be any integer number from 0 to 7, or QOS_UNKNOWN.
@item sequence_selection
This affects the SLS (Signalling Link Selection) value that will be used for protocol classes
@code{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} and @code{N_QOS_PCLASS_1}.  This value is not normally set by the user and can
be an integer value or @code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.
@item message_priority
This affects the MP (Message Priority) value that will be used for specific messages in all protocol
classes.  This value is not normally set by the use and can be any integer value from 0 to 3 or the
value @code{QOS_UNKNOWN}.
@end table

@section T_INFO_ACK Values

The following discusses the values which may be returned in the T_INFO_ACK
primitive in response to a T_INFO_REQ primitive.

@table @emph
@item TSDU_size
TCAP has effectively no limit to the amount of data which can be sent in a particular invoke or
result user data.  TCAP includes a ``more'' bit concept in that an Invoke Not Last and Return Result
Not Last can be used to indicated that the next Invoke or Return Result are part of the same user
data sequence.  ITU-T does not include the Not Last concept for Invokes.  As a result, for ANSI and
other TCAPs supporting the Invoke Not Last user data, TSDU_size will be set to T_INFINITE (-1).  For
other TCAPs not supporting Invoke Not Last, the TSDU_size will be set to the maximum size of a
single user data sequence derived from the maximum size of the underlying SCCP network.  This may
still be T_INFINITE (-1) as the underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size
NSDUs.
@item ETSDU_size
TCAP has no expedited data service and the value of ETSDU_size is set to T_UNKNOWN (-2).
@item CDATA_size
TCAP can send connection data (user data) with the initial Begin (Query) or first Continue
(Conversation) package and can also send Application Context and User Information in either package.
These messages correspond to TR-BEGIN and the first TR-CONTINUE after receiving a TR-BEGIN and these
correspond to T_CONN_REQ and T_CONN_RES.  Because the underlying SCCP connectionless network may
support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may be set to T_INFINITE (-1) or may be set to the maximum
amount of connection data (including Application Context, User Information and user data) which can
be sent or received in either package.  This informs the user as to wht size to make data buffers
associated with connection indications and confirmations (T_CONN_IND, T_CONN_CON) and how much data
can be sent with connection requests and responses (T_CONN_REQ, T_CONN_RES).
@item DDATA_size
TCAP can send disconnect data (user data) with the final End (Response) package.  These messages
correspond to the TR-END primitive and the T_DISCON_REQ or T_DISCON_IND.  Again, because the
underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may be set to
T_INFINITE (-1) or may be set to the maximum amount of disconnection data which can be sent or
received in the End (Response) package.  This informs the user as to what size to make data buffers
associated with disconnection indications (T_DISCON_IND) and how much data can be sent with
disconnection requests (T_DISCON_REQ).
@item ADDR_size
This is the maximum TCAP address size which can be communicated across the interface.  This address
size is the maximum size of the defined SCCP address structure (@code{sizeof sccp_addr_t}) which
also will include address digits up to a maximum of @code{SCCP_MAX_ADDR_LENGTH} octets of digits.
This informs the user as to what size it should reserve for control buffers so as to receive control
information without buffer truncation.
@item OPT_size
This is the maximum size of the options field used in any TPI message and is the sum of the maximum
option sizes of one of each of the options that can occur together.  This informs the user as to
what size is should reserve for control buffers to ensure that received control messages which
include options can be contained within the buffer without truncation.
@item TIDU_size
Even though a TCAP provider can support unlimited TSDU size, it cannot normally support unlimited
TIDU size.  This is because the underlying SCCP NSDU may be limited in size.  The TCAP provider is
not responsible for segmenting user data sequences offered to the provider from the user in as
M_DATA.
@prindex M_DATA
This is the maximum size of the TIDU which corresponds to the maximum size of the underlying NSDU.
Because the underlying SCCP provider may have no limit on the NSDU size (i.e., it supports
segmentation of connectionless NSDUs) this may be more in the manner of a optimal recommendation to
the user rather than an absolute maximum.  Because of this, a given TCAP provider might not reject
TIDUs which are larger than this value.
@item SERV_type
There are two service type supported by an ACSE provider: T_COTS and T_CLTS.  T_CLTS (ACSE
Connectionless Class) is a connectionless transaction service with no error notification.  T_COTS
(ACSE Connection-Oriented Class) is a connection-oriented transaction services with or without error
notification.  The value reflected here is dependent on the setting of option T_ACSE_PCLASS or
T_TCAP_PCLASS.
@item CURRENT_state
Provides the current state of the Transport Provider.  TCAP providers use the same states as other
TPI providers.
@item PROVIDER_flag
TPI provider flags which are set are SENDZERO (because TCAP supports the sending of packages without
user data) and XPG4_1 (to indicate that the transport provider supports the latest TPI semantics).

Notes:
@enumerate 
@item The @emph{Quality of Service} parameter is implicit to the stream.  Each
Operation Class 1, 2 or 3 stream (structured dialogue) either has a sequence
control value associated with the stream or a new sequence control is selected
for each package in a transaction.  Thus, this parameter does not need to be
specified by the T-User.  If the T-User wants to change the return option or
sequence control associated with a TR-U-ABORT, this can be performed with the
T_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive before the T_DISCON_REQ primitive is issued.
@item The @emph{Transaction ID} and @emph{Dialogue ID} are implicit to the
stream when the transaction association is fully formed.  When the transaction
association has not been confirmed and an TR-U-ABORT is issued, the SEQ_number
parameter identifies the transaction or dialogue in question.

@end enumerate 

@subsection Parameter Mapping

@subsubsection TR Sub-Layer Parameters

@subsubsection Quality of Service
The @emph{Quality of Service} parameters map to the @code{N_QOS_SEL_SCCP}
quality of service parameter set which can be placed in the @emph{OPT_length}
and @emph{OPT_offset} fields of the appropriate messages.  The
@code{N_qos_sel_sccp_t} structure has the Return Option and Sequence Control
parameters referenced in the Q.771 recommendations.

@subsubheading Destination Address

The @emph{Destination Address} is an SCCP Called Party Address in the format
specified for the @uref{http://www.openss7.org/spi_idx.html,SCCP Newtork}.  This
parameter is contained in the @emph{DEST_length} and @emph{DEST_offset} fields
of the appropriate TPI primitives.  It is also contained in the
@emph{REMADDR_length} and @emph{REMADDR_offset} fields of the T_ADDR_ACK
management primitive.

@subsubheading Originating Address

The @emph{Originating Address} is an SCCP Calling Party Address in the format
specified for the @uref{http://www.openss7.org/spi_idx.html,SCCP Newtork}.  This
parameter is contained in the @emph{SRC_length} and @emph{SRC_offset} or
@emph{RES_length} and @emph{RES_offset} fields of the appropriate TPI
primitives.  It is also contained in the @emph{LOCADDR_length} and
@emph{LOCADDR_offset} fields in the T_ADDR_ACK management primitive.

@subsubheading P-Abort

@subsubheading Transaction ID

The @emph{Transaction ID} parameter is normally implicit to the stream for a
fully associated transaction.  Each stream supports only one fully associated
transactions.  For unaccepted or unconfirmed transactions, the @emph{SEQ_number}
field of the appropriate TPI primitive is use to identify the transaction.  The
@emph{Transaction ID} is, therefore, implicit to the connection or connection
indication.

@subsubheading Termination

Whether the termination is pre-arranged or basic is a characteristic of the
stream.
