.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "pl_t RW_RDLOCK(rwlock_t *" lockp ", pl_t " pl );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the read/write lock to acquire in read mode.
.TP
.I pl
A priority level to set if required before attempting to acquire the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9)
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
sets the priority level specified by the
.I pl
argument using
.BR spl (9)
and then acquires the read/write lock specified by the
.I lockp
argument in read mode.
If the lock cannot be acquired immediately, the calling processor will spin
(or block) waiting for the lock to be released.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
returns the priority level that was prevailing at the time that
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
was called.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is always successful.  If
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is called with invalid or uninitialized arguments, the results will be
indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
It is not necessary to raise the priority level using the
.I pl
argument if there is never an attempt to take a read lock on
.I lockp
from interrupt service routine context.
.PP
When called from interrupt service routine context, the caller must not lower
the prevailing priority level with the
.I pl
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Read/write locks of type
.BR rwlock_t
are not fully recursive.  Calling
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
for a read/write lock that has been locked for write by the calling processor with
.BR RW_WRLOCK ()
will result in single party deadlock.
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is implemented by calling
.BR spl (9)
with the
.I pl
argument and then taking a read lock on the
.I lockp
using
.BR read_lock (9).
The old interrupt priority level returned from
.BR spl (9)
is returned to the caller.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_RDLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for more compatibility information.
