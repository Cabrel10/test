.SH NAME
.B qenable, lis_qenable
\- schedules a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue service routine
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void qenable(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue to enable.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qenable ()
schedules the service procedure of the queue pointed to by
.I q
to be run by
.BR runqueues () .
If the queue pointed to by
.I q
has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable (9),
then
.BR qenable ()
will silently fail.
Whether the queue can be scheduled with
.BR qenable ()
can be determined with a call to
.BR canenable (9).
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is normally called to indirectly invoke the execution of
.IR q 's
service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qenable ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qenable ()
fails silently if
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointed to by
.I q
has a
.I q_info
pointer of
.BR NULL ;
.I q
has no service procedure;
.I q
is closing;
or,
.I q
has had put and service routine processing turned off
(e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9));
or,
.I q
has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
If the queue was not already enabled
.RB ( srv (9)
procedure already scheduled to run) on a different CPU,
.BR qenable ()
schedules the service procedure of
.I q
on the current CPU.  In this case, the queue service procedure for
.I q
will not execute until after
.BR qenable ()
returns and the function that called
.BR qenable ()
returns or encounters a preemption point.
However, if the queue is already scheduled by another processor  and
.BR qenable ()
was not called from a context synchronous with the service procedure, another
processor may run the service procedure before
.BR qenable ()
returns.
.PP
Therefore,
.BR qenable ()
should be called with
.I STREAMS
synchronization in effect, or hold the necessary private locks across the
call to
.BR qenable (),
if it is ncessary to synchronize the call to
.BR qenable ()
with execution of the service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICE
.PP
.BR qenable ()
has no effect if
.B QNOENB
is set,
the queue has already been enabled due to internal
.I STREAMS
scheduler actions, or a previous call to
.BR qenable ()
that has not yet completed service.
.PP
Enabling a queue from within its own
.BR srv (9)
procedure will not reschedule the service procedure.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR canenable (9),
.BR noenable (9),
.BR enableok (9).
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
Under
.IR LiS ,
.[
LiS
.]
.BR qenable ()
will not enable a queue previously disabled with
.BR enableok ()
or
.BR qprocsoff ().
.PP
.I LiS
source code,
.[
LiS
.]
on the other hand shows that no queue will be enabled while the
.BR QNOENB ", "  QPROCSOFF " or " QCLOSING
flags are set.
.BR qenable ()
should schedule a queue regardless of whenther
.BR noenable (9)
was called for the queue.
.PP
.I LiS
has a nasty bug in
.BR qenable ()
requiring the non-standard
.BR canenable (9)
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qenable ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qenable ()
only schedules the queue for later service.
.IP \(em
.BR qenable ()
schedules a queue regardless of whether the
.B QNOENB
flag is set, or whether
.BR noenable (9)
has been called for the queue,
.IR q .
Under
.IR LiS ,
.[
LiS
.]
.BR qenable ()
will not enable a queue previously disabled with
.BR enableok ()
or
.BR qprocsoff ().
This is an
.I LiS
bug.
.IP \(em
.BR qenable ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR qenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR qenable ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR qenable ()
enables the queue regardless of the settings of other flags.
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation
.[
uw7doc
.]
explicitly states that
.BR qenable ()
schedules the queue regardless of whether
.BR noenable (9)
was invoked on the queue previously.

.IR OSF/1 \(rg
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
documentation

.]
do not say that
.BR noenable (9)
defeats
.BR qenable ()
either.
.I LiS
source code,
.[
LiS
.]
on the other hand shows that no queue will be enabled while the
.BR QNOENB ", "  QPROCSOFF " or " QCLOSING
flags are set.
This is an

bug.
.IP \(em
.I LiS
has a nasty bug in

requiring the non-standard

function.

implementation, use
