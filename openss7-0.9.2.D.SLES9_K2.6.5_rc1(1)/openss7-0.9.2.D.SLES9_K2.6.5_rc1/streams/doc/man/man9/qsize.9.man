.SH NAME

\- return the number of messages on a queue
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int qsize(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to return the count of the number of
messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Some networking protocols are more interested in the number of messages held in a queue than they
are in the number of bytes contained in the queue.
.BR qsize ()
provides a mechanism to return the number of messages (whereas
.IR q->q_count
is usually good enough for the count).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qsize ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible for the validity of
.I q
across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
implements
.BR qsize ()
by keeping a count of the number of messages on a queue in the
.BR queue_t
structure.  This permits faster performance for protocols that require message
counts as well as data byte counts.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR strqget (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
maintains a count of the messages on a given queue or queue band in the
.BR queue_t (9)
structure.  Therefore, the messages do not need to be counted when
.BR qsize ()
is called.
.IP ""
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR qsize ()
must lock the queue and walk the buffer chains counting the number of messages
on the queue for each invocation.
.I LiS
is inefficient if many calls to
.BR qsize ()
are performed by a given
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
always succeeds.
.I LiS
returns zero (0) on failure.
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer can panic the system.
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer will return zero (0).
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not call
.BR qsize ()
with a
.B NULL
or invalid queue pointer,
.IR q .
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
do not permit
.BR qsize ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

.IR HP-UX \(rg

lists

as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[

also lists
.BR qsize ()
as a utility that cannot be called from user functions or
.RI non- STREAMS
code; that is, contexts asynchronous to the Stream containing
.IR q .
.IP ""

compatible drivers and modules will not call

from outside of a
