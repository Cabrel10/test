.TH DL_DISCONNECT_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (dl_disconnect_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider to disconnect an active data link connection or
one that was in the process of activation, either outgoing or incoming, as a
result of an earlier
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
or
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
requests the DLS provider to disconnect an active data link connection or one
that was in the process of activation, either outgoing or incoming, as a
result of an earlier
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
or
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7).
If an incoming
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
is being refused, the correlation number associated with that connect
indication must be supplied.  The message indicates the reason for the
disconnect.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block containing the structure shown below.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_reason;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_correlation;
} dl_disconnect_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_reason
conveys the reason for the disconnect:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_DISC_NORMAL_CONDITION
normal release of a data link connection
.TP
.B DL_DISC_ABNORMAL_CONDITION
abnormal release of a data link connection
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_PERMANENT_COND
a permanent condition caused the rejection of a connect request
.TP
.B DL_CONREJ_TRANSIENT_COND
a transient condition caused the rejection of a connect request
.TP
.B DL_DISC_UNSPECIFIED
reason unspecified.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_correlation
if non-zero, conveys the correlation number that was contained in the
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
being rejected (see
.I \*(lqMulti-threaded Connection Establishment,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7)).
This value permits the DLS provider to associate the primitive with the proper
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
when rejecting an incoming connection.  If the disconnect request is releasing
a connection that is already established, or is aborting a previously sent
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7),
the value of
.I dl_correlation
should be zero.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any of the states
.BR DL_DATAXFER ,
.BR DL_INCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_OUTCON_PENDING ,
.BR DL_PROV_RESET_PENDING ,
.BR DL_USER_RESET_PENDING .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is one of the disconnect pending states, as defined in
.I \*(lqAllowable Sequence of DLPI Primitives,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
.SH RESPONSE
If the disconnect is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user resulting in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.PP
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned, and the resulting state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADCORR
The correlation number specified in this primitive did not correspond to
apending connect indication.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
