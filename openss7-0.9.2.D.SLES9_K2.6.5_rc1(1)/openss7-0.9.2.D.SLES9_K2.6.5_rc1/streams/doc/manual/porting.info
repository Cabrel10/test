1 Porting
*********

Although each of the manual pages of supported functions and structures
provides compatiblity and porting information, this document attempts to gather
together pertinent information concerning porting from various UNIX operating
system supporting STREAMS.

The porting information is organized by the operating system from which porting
is being attempted.  Note that, aside from configuration details, any system
not listed here that is based on SVR 4.2 MP or on a another of the
implementations, should start with that implementation's portability
information.

Porting information is organized into sections as follows:

* Menu:

* Porting from SVR 4.2 MP::
* Porting from AIX 5L Version 5.1::
* Porting from HP-UX 11.0i v2::
* Porting from OSF/1 1.2/Digital UNIX::
* Porting from UnixWare 7.1.3 (OpenUnix 8)::
* Porting from Solaris 9/SunOS 5.9::
* Porting from SUPER-UX::
* Porting from UXP/V::
* Porting from Linux STREAMS (LiS) 2.18.1::

1.2 Porting from SVR 4.2 MP
===========================

This section captures portability information for SVR 4.2 MP based systems.  If
the operating system from which you are porting more closely fits one of the
other portability sections, please see that section.

1.2.1 Differences from SVR 4.2 MP
---------------------------------

Linux Fast-STREAMS has very few differences from `SVR 4.2 MP'.  Not all `SVR
4.2 MP' functions are implemented in the base Linux Fast-STREAMS kernel
modules.  Some functions are included in the `SVR 4.2 MP' compatibility module,
`streams-svr4compat.o'.

* Menu:

* Priority Levels::
* Basic Locks::


File: porting.info,  Node: Priority Levels,  Next: Basic Locks,  Up: Differences from SVR 4.2 MP

1.2.1.1 Priority Levels
.......................

Linux has a different concept of priority levels than `SVR 4.2 MP'.  Linux has
basically 4 priority levels as follows:

  1. Preemptive

     At this priority level, software and hardware interrupts are enabled and
     the kernel is executing with premption enabled.  This means that the
     currently executing kernel thread could preempt and sleep in favor of
     another thread of kernel execution.

     This priority level only exists on preemptive (mostly 2.6) kernels.

  2. Non-Preemptive

     At this priority level, software and hardware interrupts are enabled and
     the kernel is executing with preemption disabled.  This means that the
     currently executing kernel thread will only be interrupted by sofware or
     hardware interrupts.

     This priority level exists in all kernels.

  3. Software Interrupts Disabled

     At this priority level, software interrupts are disabled and the kernel is
     executing with preemption disabled.  This means that the currently
     executing kernel thread will only be interrupted by hardware interrupts.

     This is the case when the executing thread is processing a software
     interrupt, or when the currently executing thread has disabled software
     interrupts.

     This priority level exists in all kernels.

  4. Interrupt Service Routines Disabled

     At this priority level, hardware interrupts are disabled and the kernel is
     executing with preemption disabled.  This means that the currently
     executing kernel thread will not be interrupted.

     This is the case when the executing thread is processing a hardware
     interrupt, or when the currently executing thread has disabled hardware
     interrupts.

     This priority level exists in all kernels.

2.1 Portable `STREAMS' Drivers and Modules
==========================================

In the process of creating the Linux Fast-STREAMS subsystem in such a way so as
to facilitate portability of `STREAMS' drivers and modules from a wide range of
`UNIX' operating system variants, a number of guidelines for the development of
portable `STREAMS' drivers and moduels have been developed.  These guidelines,
when adhered to, will allow the resulting driver or module to be ported to
another `STREAMS' implementation with minimal effort.  These portability
guidelines are collected here.

File: porting.info,  Node: Memory Allocation,  Next: Alignment of Message Buffers,  Up: Portable STREAMS Drivers and Modules

2.1.1 Memory Allocation
-----------------------

Portable `STREAMS' modules and drivers will always allocate memory using the
SVR4 memory allocators/deallocators: *note (*manpages*)kmem_alloc(9)::, *note
(*manpages*)kmem_zalloc(9):: and *note (*manpages*)kmem_free(9)::.

Additional eligible allocators are:

*note (*manpages*)rmallocmap(9):: *note (*manpages*)rmfreemap(9):: *note
(*manpages*)rmalloc(9):: *note (*manpages*)rmalloc_wait(9):: *note
(*manpages*)rmfree(9):: *note (*manpages*)rminit(9):: *note
(*manpages*)rmsetwant(9):: *note (*manpages*)rmwanted(9)::

Unfortunately, these resource map allocators are not available on `AIX' so, if
portability to the `AIX PSE' is important, then do not use these allocators.

Additional eligible allocators are:

*note (*manpages*)kmem_fast_alloc(9):: *note (*manpages*)kmem_fast_free(9)::

2.1.3 Disabling and Enabling Queue Procedures
---------------------------------------------

Portable `STREAMS' modules and drivers will always call *note
(*manpages*)qprocson(9)::, before returning from its queue open procedure (see
*note (*manpages*)qopen(9)::.)

Portable `STREAMS' modules and drivers will always call *note
(*manpages*)qprocsoff(9)::, upon entering its queue close procedure (see *note
(*manpages*)qclose(9)::.)

File: porting.info,  Node: Timeout Call Back and Link Identifiers,  Next: Synchronization with Timeouts and Callback Functions,  Prev: Passing Messages from Interrupt Service Routines,  Up: Portable STREAMS Drivers and Modules

2.1.6 Timeout Call Back and Link Identifiers
--------------------------------------------

Although buffer callbacks identifiers (see *note (*manpages*)bufcall(9)::),
timeout identifiers (see *note (*manpages*)timeout(9)::), and multiplexing
driver link identifiers (see I_LINK and I_PLINK under *note
(*manpages*)streamio(2)::), are often illustrated as small integer numbers,
with some `STREAMS' implementations, including Linux Fast-STREAMS, these
identifiers are kernel addresses (pointers) and are never small integer values
like 1, 2, or 3.

Also, there is no guarantee that the identifier will be positive.  It is
guaranteed that the retuned identifier will not be zero (0).  Zero is used by
these function as a return value to indicate an error.

Portable `STREAMS' drivers and modules will not depend upon the returned
identifier from *note (*manpages*)bufcall(9)::, *note (*manpages*)timeout(9)::
or *note (*manpages*)streamio(2):: as being any specific range of value.
Portable drivers and modules will save any returned identifiers in data types
that will not loose the precision of the identifier.

-------------------------------------------------------

 UNIX Device Numbering
......................

     In versions of `UNIX System V' previous to `Release 4', the major and
     minor device numbers were each 8 bit, and they were packed into a 16 bit
     word (usually a C Language SHORT variable).  Under `UNIX System V Release
     4', the device numbers are held in a `dev_t' variable, which is often
     implemented as a 32 bit integer.  The minor device number is held as 14
     bits, and a further 8 bits are used for the major device number.  `dev_t' is
     ofter referred to as the "expanded device type", since it allows many more
     minor devices than before.

     Many drivers were written for earlier releases, an may eventually be
     ported to `UNIX System V Release 4'.  In earlier releases, some
     manufacturers got around the 256 minor device number limit by using
     multiple major device numbers for a device.  Devices were created with
     different major device numbers (the external major device number) but they
     all mapped to the same deivce driver entry in the device switch tables
     (the internal device number).  Even under this scheme, each major device
     could only support 256 minor devices, but the driver could support many
     more.  This has been recognized in `UNIX System V Release 4', and
     functions are provided to do this mapping; for example, the function
     `etoimajor'() and so on, give a machine independent interface to the
     device number mapping.  (1)

 Linux Device Numbering
.......................

Verions of the Linux kernel in the 2.4 kernel series and prior to 2.6 also
provided an 8 bit major device number and an 8 bit minor device number grouped
into a 16-bit combined device number.  Linux 2.6 kernels (and some patched 2.4
kernels) now have larger device numbers.  These extended device numbers are 12
bits for major device number and 20 bits for minor device number, with 32 bits
for the combined device number.

 LiS Device Numbering
.....................

`LiS' prior to the 2.18.0 release was incapable of providing an internal
representation of the device number and the number of minor device numbers for a
device driver was restricted to 256.  (2)  Many OpenSS7
(http://www.openss7.org/) device drivers written for `LiS' would allocate
additional major device numbers if required.  Good examples of devices that
require more than 255 minor device numbers are INET clone devices, SCTP
streams, SS7 singalling link streams, MG media channels, etc.  These streams
are often I_PLINKed under a multiplexing driver and do not even consume a
system file descriptor.

 Linux Fast-STREAMS Device Numbering
....................................

Linux Fast-STREAMS began with extended device numbering.  The `specfs' shadow
special character device filesystem used by Linux Fast-STREAMS uses the `inode'
number to hold the `dev_t' device number instead of the `inode->i_rdev', which
on older kernels is only a 16-bit SHORT.

In earlier versions of Linux Fast-STREAMS, the internal device numbering is
16-bits for major device number and 16-bits for minor device number.  This will
soon be changed to 12-bits for major device number and 20-bits for minor device
number to accomodate the newer Linux scheme.

On 2.6 Linux kernels that support the newer extended device numbers, external
device numbers and internal device numbers will be the same.  On 2.4 Linux
kernels with the older 16-bit device numbers, external device number and
internal device numbers will differ.  In some situations, an internal device
number can exists with no corresponding external device number (accessed only
via a clone device or direct access to the mounted `specfs' shadow special
character device filesystem).

show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
     placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
     terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any
     such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
     Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
     containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
     Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
     the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
     only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
     of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends
     on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
     as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
     disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
     License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
     of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
     may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
     thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
     modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
     you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
          that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
          or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
          thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
          under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
          run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
          in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
          including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
          no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
          users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
          telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if
          the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
          an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
     sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
     reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
     this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
     distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
     sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
     distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
     permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
     each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
     rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
     the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
     based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
     scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
     Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
     and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
          code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
          above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
          give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
          physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
          distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed
          only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
          program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
          accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
     modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means
     all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
     interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
     and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
     source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
     distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
     (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
     executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
     copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
     source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
     even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
     the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
     expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
     modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
     automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
     However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
     Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if
     you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing
     the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
     copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
     the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
     to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
     conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
     recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute
     so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
     any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
     distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not
     permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
     satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
     distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
     particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
     and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
     claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
     the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
     license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the
     wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
     consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
     decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
     system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
     consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
     countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
     copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
     explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
     so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
     written in the body of this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
     similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
     Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
     whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
     for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
     Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
     exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
     preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
     promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                    NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
     THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
     ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.1.2 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
---------------------------------------------------

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
License instead of this License.

B.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================



                        GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
                            Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

B.1.1 Preamble
--------------

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.  But this License
is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
     placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
     terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any such manual
     or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
     "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
     and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
     Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
     authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
     matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
     subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject
     or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical
     or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
     designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
     that the Document is released under this License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
     Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
     Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
     public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
     pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
     drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
     automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
     formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
     markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
     by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
     "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
     without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
     using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
     designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
     proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
     generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
     such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
     License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which
     do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
     most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of
     the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
     notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
     Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
     conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical
     measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
     copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in
     exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies
     you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
     may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
     copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
     Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
     cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
     publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
     with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to
     the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
     these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
     you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
     actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
     than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
     along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
     publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
     general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
     option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
     distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
     copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
     Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
     them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
     conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
     Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
     filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
     modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
     In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
          from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
          should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
          Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if the
          original publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
          responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
          Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
          Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
          Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
          to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
          giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
          terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
          and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
          an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
          of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
          section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
          title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
          Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
          stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
          public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
          network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
          based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You may
          omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
          years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
          version it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications", preserve
          the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance
          and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments and/or
          dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
          their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
          are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not
          be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
          in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
     that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
     Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
     as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
     Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be
     distinct from any other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
     example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
     an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
     passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
     Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
     and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
     by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the
     same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
     entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
     that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
     permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
     endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
     License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
     provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
     of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
     Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
     identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there
     are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
     make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
     parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
     if known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
     the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in
     the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History";
     likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgments", and any sections
     entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections entitled
     "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
     released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
     License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
     the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
     verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
     it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
     License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
     respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
     independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
     the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
     compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
     License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
     with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
     not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
     of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the
     entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
     surround only the Document within the aggregate.  Otherwise they must
     appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
     translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
     Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
     their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
     Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
     Sections.  You may include a translation of this License provided that you
     also include the original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English version of
     this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
     expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to copy,
     modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
     automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
     Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
     similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.  See `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  If
     the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
     "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
     version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
     Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version number of this
     License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

B.1.2 How to use this License for your documents
------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead
of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write
"no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.
