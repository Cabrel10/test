.I hierarchy
Hierarchy value which asserts the order in which this lock will be acquired
relative to other basic and read/write locks.
.TP
.I min_pl
Minimum priority level argument that asserts the level that will be passed in
with any attempt to acquire this lock.  See

and

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9)
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
dynamically allocates and initializes a read/write lock structure of type
.B rwlock_t
and returns a pointer to the structure.  When
.B KM_SLEEP
is set in the
.I flag
argument, the call will always be successful.  When
.B KM_NOSLEEP
is set in the
.I flag
argument, the call will fail if resources for the allocation are not
immediately available, and
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
will return
.BR NULL .
.PP
Read/write locks allocated and initialized with
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
can be deallocated with
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is used to dynamically allocate read/write locks.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the allocated and initialized
.BR rwlock_t
structure;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
fails when 
.I flag
is set to
.B KM_NOSLEEP
and sufficient resources for the allocation are not immediately available.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
can only be called from user or blocking context only when
.B KM_SLEEP
is set in
.IR flag .
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
can be called from any context when
.B KM_NOSLEEP
is set in
.IR flag .
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
does not perform any of the naming or statistics gathering function described
in the
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
documentation.  The
.IR lkinfop ", " hierarchy " and " lkinfop
arguments are ignored.
Only the
.I flag
argument is honoured.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is implemented by allocating a
.B rwlock_t
structure using
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
and initialized with
.BR rwlock_init (9).

.SH BUGS
.PP

has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I hierarchy
argument.
The underlying
.B Linux
read/write locks are incapable of tracking lock hierarchies.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I min_pl
argument.
.B Linux
does not implement interrupt priority levels in the same manner as
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" :
either interrupts are enabled or they are not.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
does not perform any of the naming or statistics gathering functions described
in the
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
documentation.
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
ignores the
.I lkinfop
argument.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
does not support basic, sleep, synchronization or read/write lock statistics or
debugging in the manner of
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" .
.IP \(em
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_ALLOC ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
