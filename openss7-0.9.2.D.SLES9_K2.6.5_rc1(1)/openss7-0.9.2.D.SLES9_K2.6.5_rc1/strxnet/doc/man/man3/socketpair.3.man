.SH NAME
.B socketpair
\- create a pair of connected sockets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int socketpair(int " domain ", int " type ", int " protocol ", int " socket_vector[2] );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR socketpair ()
function creates an unbound pair of connected
sockets in a specified
.IR domain ,
of a specified
.IR type ,
under the
protocol optionally specified by the
.I protocol
argument.  The two
sockets are identical.  The file descriptors used in referencing the
created sockets are returned in
.I socket_vector[0]
and
.IR socket_vector[1] .
.TP
.I domain
Specifies the communications domain in which the sockets are to
be created.
.TP
.I type
Specifies the type of sockets to be created.
.TP
.I protocol
Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the sockets.
Specifying a
.I protocol
of 0 causes
.BR socketpair ()
to use an
unspecified default protocol appropriate for the requested
socket type.
.TP
.I socket_vector
Specifies a 2-integer array to hold the file descriptors of the
created socket pair.
.PP
The
.I type
argument specifies the socket type, which determines the
semantics of communications over the socket.  The socket types
supported by the system are implementation-dependent.  Possible
socket types include:
.TP
.B SOCK_STREAM
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode
byte streams, and may provide a transmission mechanism for
out-of-band data.
.TP
.B SOCK_DGRAM
Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode, unreliable
messages of fixed maximum length.
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode
transmission path for records.  A record can be sent using one
or more output operations and received using one or more input
operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more
than one record.  Record boundaries are visible to the receiver
via the
.B MSG_EOR
flag.
.PP
If the
.I protocol
argument is non-zero, it must specify a protocol
that is supported by the address family.  The protocols supported by
the system are implementation-dependent.
.PP
The process may need to have appropriate privileges to use the
.BR socketpair ()
function or to create some sockets.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The documentation for specific address families specifies which
protocols each address family supports.  The documentation for
specific protocols specifies which socket types each
.I protocol
supports.
.PP
The
.BR socketpair ()
function is used primarily with UNIX domain
sockets and need not be supported for other domains.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, this function returns 0.  Otherwise, -1
is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR socketpair ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EAFNOSUPPORT ]
The implementation does not support the specified address
family.
.TP
.RB [ EMFILE ]
No more file descriptors are available for this process.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
No more file descriptors are available for the system.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP ]
The specified
.I protocol
does not permit creation of socket
pairs.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTONOSUPPORT ]
The
.I protocol
is not supported by the address family, or the
.I protocol
is not supported by the implementation.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTOTYPE ]
The socket
.I type
is not supported by the
.IR protocol .
.PP
The
.BR socketpair ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
The process does not have appropriate privileges.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform
the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient
.IR STREAMS (4)
resources available for the
operation to complete.
