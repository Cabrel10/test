.TH T_RCVLEAFCHANGE 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B t_rcvleafchange
\- receive addition of point to point to multipoint connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvleafchange(int " fd ", struct t_leaf_status *" change );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint for which to receive leaf change information.
.TP
.I change
a poitner to a
.B t_leaf_status
structure to contain returned information about the leaf change.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
recieves a leaf change indication or confirmation.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which the leaf change indication
or confirmation was received.
.PP
.I change
is a pointer to a
.B t_leaf_status
structure that returns information about the leaf change.
The
.B t_leaf_status
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_leaf_status {
	int leafid;
	int status;
	int reason;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_leaf_status
structure specifies the following members and information:
.TP
.I leafid
returns an identifier of the leaf to which the status applies.
.TP
.I status
returns the status of the identified leaf and can be one of the following
values:
.RS
.TP 14
.B T_CONNECT
the leaf has joined the point to multipoint connection.
.TP 14
.B T_DISCONNECT
the leaf has left the point to multipoint connection.  The
.I reason
field indicates the reason for leaving.
.RE
.TP
.I reason
returns the reason for disconnect.  When
.I status
is
.BR T_CONNECT ,
this field is meaningless.
.I reason
values are transport service provider specific.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_DATAXFER .
.PP
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD
that support point to multipoint connection management.
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
blocks unit a leaf change confirmation is received.  In asynchronous mode
where not leaf change confirmation is immediately available,
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNODATA .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvleafchange ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODATA ]
An attempt was made to read data but no data indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
