.SH NAME
.B DL_TEST_REQ (dl_test_req_t)
\- conveys one TEST command DLSDU from the DLS User to the DLS Provider
for transmission to a peer DLS Provider.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by zero or more
.B M_DATA
blocks containing zero or more bytes of data.  The message structure is
as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_flag;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_offset;
} dl_test_req_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_TEST_REQ
conveys one TEST command DLSDU from the DLS User to the DLS Provider
for transmission to a peer DLS Provider.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_TEST_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_flag
indicates flag values for the request as follows:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_POLL_FINAL
indicates if the poll/final bit is set.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address of the destination DLS User.  If the
destination user is implemented using DLPI, this address is the full DLSAP
address returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK .
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where
the destination DLSAP address begins.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in states
.BR DL_IDLE
and
.BR DL_DATAXFER .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
On an invalid TEST command request, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is issued to the user.  If
the DLS Provider receives a response from the remote side, a
.BR DL_TEST_CON (7)
is issued to the DLS User.  It is recommended that the DLS User use a timeout
procedure to recover from a situation when there is no response from the peer
DLS User.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The DLSAP address information was invalid or was in an incorrect
format.
.TP
.B DL_BADDATA
The amount of data exceeded the DLS provider's limit for TEST messages.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A System error has occurred and the Linux System error is indicated in
the DL_ERROR_ACK.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is known but not supported by the DLS Provider
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state
.TP
.B DL_TESTAUTO
Previous bind request specified automatic handling of TEST responses.
.TP
.B DL_UNSUPPORTED
Requested service not supplied by provider.
