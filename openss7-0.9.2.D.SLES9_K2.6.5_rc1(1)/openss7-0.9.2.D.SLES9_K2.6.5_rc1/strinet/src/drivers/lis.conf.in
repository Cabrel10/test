## Driver specifications
##
## multiple major numbers for a driver may be allocated two ways:
## . by explicitly requesting n-majors (see below)
## . by requesting an n-minors value large enough to require more than
##   one major number.
##
## strconf now supports allocating multiple major numbers, but
## not all drivers do.  It is only known to work for 'fifo' at this time.
##
##	name		prefix	major	n-minors  n-majors
driver	inet		ss_	30
driver	udp2		udp	*
driver	rawip2		raw	*
driver	tcp2		tcp	*

##
## Object name specifications
##
##	type	name		object name
objname	driver	inet		inet
objname	driver	udp2		udp
objname	driver	rawip2		rawip
objname	driver	tcp2		tcp

##
## Loadable specifications
##
## If you do not have a system with support for demand-loading modules
## into the kernel, you will have to load these modules by hand or in
## the startup scripts.
## If you do not use the loadable keyword at all, everything is linked
## into streams.o.
##
loadable inet
loadable udp2
loadable rawip2
loadable tcp2

##
## Node specifications
##
## Loop driver now makes its own nodes in its init routine as an 
## example of how to use lis_mknod.
##
##	name	          type	perm	major		minor
##
## These are iBCS devices that should already be installed on a
## system that supports the iBCS.  The /dev entries are supposed
## to by symbolic links to the /dev/inet entries.  arp and rip
## are supposed to be symbolic links to udp
