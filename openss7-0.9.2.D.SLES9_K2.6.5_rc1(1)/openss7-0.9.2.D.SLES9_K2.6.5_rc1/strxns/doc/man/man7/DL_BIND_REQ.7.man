\- requests the DLS provider bind a DLSAP to the stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_sap;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_max_conind;

    t_uscalar_t  dl_xidtest_flg;
} dl_bind_req_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_BIND_REQ
requests the DLS provider bind a DLSAP to the stream.  The DLS user must
identify the address of the DLSAP to be bound to the stream.
Forconnection-mode service, the DLS user also indicates whether it will accept
incoming connection requests on the stream.  Finally, the request directs the
DLS provider to activate the stream associated with the DLSAP.
.PP
A stream is viewed as active when the DLS provider may transmit and receive
protocol data units destined to or originating from the stream.  The PPA
associated with each stream must be initialized upon completion of the
processing of the
.B DL_BIND_REQ
(see PPA Initialization/De-initialization
.BR dlpi (7)).
More specifically, the DLS user is ensured that the PPA is initialized
when the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7)
is received.  If the PPA cannot be initialized, the
.B DL_BIND_REQ
will fail.
.PP
A stream may be bound as a "connection management" stream, such that it will
receive all connect requests that arrive through a given PPA (see
Connection Management Stream
.BR dlpi (7)).
In this case, the
.I dl_sap
will be ignored.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_BIND_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_sap
conveys sufficient information to identify the DLSAP that will be bound to
the DLPI stream (see DLPI Addressing
.BR dlpi (7)
for a description of DLSAP
addresses).  The format of this information is specific to a given DLS
provider, and may contain the full DLSAP address or some portion of that
address sufficient to uniquely identify the DLSAP in question.  The full
address of the bound DLSAP will be returned in the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
.RS
.PP
The following rules are used by the DLS provider when binding a DLSAP address:
.IP - 3
The DLS provider must define and manage its DLSAP address space.
.IP -
DLPI allows the same DLSAP to be bound to multiple streams, but a given DLS
provider may need to restrict its address space to allow one stream per DLSAP.
.IP -
The DLS provider may not be able to bind the specified DLSAP address for one
of the following reasons:
.RS
.IP "1." 4
the DLS provider may statically associate a specific DLSAP with each
stream
.IP 2.
the DLS provider may only support one stream per DLSAP and the DLS user
attempted to bind a DLSAP that was already bound to another stream.
.RS
.PP
In case of reason 1, the value of
.I dl_sap
is ignored by the DLS provider
and the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7)
returns the DLSAP address that is already associated with
the stream.  In case of reason 2, if the DLS provider cannot bind the given
DLSAP to the stream, it may attempt to choose an alternate DLSAP and
return that on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
If an alternate DLSAP cannot be chosen, the
DLS provider will return a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
and set
.I dl_errno
to
.BR DL_NOADDR .
.RE
.PP
Because of the provider-specific nature of the DLSAP address, DLS user
software that is to be protocol independent should avoid hard-coding this
value.  The DLS user should retrieve the necessary DLSAP address from some
other entity (such as a management entity or higher layer protocol entity)
and insert it without inspection into the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ .
.RE
.RE
.TP
.I dl_max_conind
conveys the maximum number of outstanding
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
messages
allowed on the DLPI stream.  If the value is zero, the stream cannot accept
any
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
messages.  If greater than zero, the DLS user will accept
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
messages up to the given value before having to
respond with a
.BR DL_CONNECT_RES (7)
or a
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (7)
(see Multi-threaded Connection Establishment
.BR dlpi (7)
for details on how this value is used to support multi-threaded connect
processing).  The DLS provider may not be able to support the value supplied in
.IR dl_max_conind ,
as specified by the following rules:
.RS
.IP - 3
If the provider cannot support the specified number of outstanding
connect indications, it should set the value down to a number it can support.
.IP -
Only one stream that is bound to the indicated DLSAP may have an allowed
number of maximum outstanding connect indications greater than zero.  If a
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7)
specifies a value greater than zero, but another stream has already bound
itself to the DLSAP with a value greater than zero, the DLS provider will fail
the request, setting
.I dl_errno
to
.B DL_BOUND
on the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.IP -
If a stream with
.I dl_max_conind
greater than zero is used to accept a connection, the stream will be found
busy during the duration of the connection, and no other streams may be bound
to the same DLSAP with a value
of
.I dl_max_conind
greater than zero.  This restriction prevents more than one stream bound to
the same DLSAP from receiving connect indications and accepting connections.
Accepting a connection on such a stream is only allowed if there is just a
single outstanding connect indication being processed.
.IP -
A DLS user should always be able to request a
.I dl_max_conind
value of zero, since this indicates to the DLS provider that the stream will
only be used to originate connect requests.
.IP -
A stream with a negotiated value of
.I dl_max_conind
that is greater than zero may not originate connect requests.  This field is
ignored in connectionless-mode service.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_service_mode
conveys the desired mode of service for this stream, and may contain one of
the following:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_CODLS
connection-oriented data link service
.TP
.B DL_CLDLS
connectionless data link service
.TP
.B DL_ACLDLS
acknowledged connectionless data link service.
.PP
If the DLS provider does not support the requested service mode, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
will be generated, specifying
.BR DL_UNSUPPORTED .
.RE
.TP
.I dl_conn_mgmt
if non-zero, indicates that the stream is the "connection management"
stream for the PPA to which the stream is attached.  When an incoming connect
request arrives, the DLS provider will first look for a stream bound with
.I dl_max_conind
greater than zero that is associated with the destination DLSAP.  If such a
stream is found, the connect indication will be issued on that stream.
Otherwise, the DLS provider will issue the connect indication on the
"connection management" stream for that PPA, if one exists.  Only one
"connection management" stream is allowed per PPA, so an attempt to bind a
second connection management stream on a PPA will fail with the DLPI error set
to
.BR DL_BOUND .
When
.I dl_conn_mgmt
is non-zero, the
value of
.I dl_sap
will be ignored.  In connectionless-mode service,
.I dl_conn_mgmt
is ignored by the DLS provider.
.TP
.I dl_xidtest_flg
indicates to the DLS Provider that XID and/or TEST responses for this
stream are to be automatically generated by the DLS Provider.  The DLS
Provider will not generate
.BR DL_XID_IND (7)
and/or
.BR DL_TEST_IND (7),
and will error a
.BR DL_XID_REQ (7)
and/or
.BR DL_TEST_REQ (7).
If the DLS Provider does not support automatic handling of XID and/or TEST
responses, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
will be generated, specifying
.BR DL_NOAUTO ", " DL_NOXIDAUTO " or " DL_NOTESTAUTO .
If the Provider receives an XID or TEST request from the DLS User, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
will be generated specifying
.BR DL_XIDAUTO " or " DL_TESTAUTO
respectively.
.RS
.PP
The dl_xidtest_flg contains a bit-mask specifying zero or more of the
following values:
.TP
.B DL_AUTO_XID
automatically respond to XID commands
.TP
.B DL_AUTO_TEST
automatically respond to TEST commands.
.RE
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_UNBOUND .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_BIND_PENDING .
.SH RESPONSE
If the bind request is successful,
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user
resulting in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.PP
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting
state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
