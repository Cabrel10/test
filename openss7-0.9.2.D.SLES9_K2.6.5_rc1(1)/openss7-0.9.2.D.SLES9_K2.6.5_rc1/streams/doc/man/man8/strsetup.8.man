.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B strsetup
displays the
.I STREAMS
setup of modules and drivers or creates the appropriate character special
files for
.IR STREAMS -based
drivers.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.BI "-c, --config"
Lists the current kernel configuration of
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.  This option does not require privilege.
.TP
.BI "-d, --delete"
Deletes all of the
.B /dev
entries that correspond to
.I STREAMS
drivers.
.TP
.BI "-f, --filename " filename
Uses a files to create
.B /dev
entries for
.I STREAMS
devices.  (See
.IR "\*(lqFILE FORMAT\*(rq" ,
below.)
.TP
.BI "-i, --install"
Creates entries in
.B /dev
appropriate for the current kernel configuration.
By default, this uses the configuration file
.BR /etc/sysconf/streams/strsetup.conf .
If no file exists or is specified, only clone devices will be created.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Suppresses normal output.
.TP
\fB-D\fR, \fB--debug\fR [\fILEVEL\fr]
Increase or specify the debug output
.IR LEVEL .
When a debug
.I LEVEL
has been specified,
.B strerr
will log to
.BR stdout ,
prints debug messages to
.BR stderr ,
and will not place itself in the background.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fILEVEL\fR]
Increase or specify the verbosity
.I LEVEL
of the output.  This option may be repeated.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
When this options is encountered,
.B strsetup
displays usage information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strsetup
displays versions information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B strsetup
displays copying and copyright information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
Each line in the configuration file is of the format:
.RB < driver_name "> <" filename "> <" file_mode "> <" minor_number >.
.TP
.RB < driver_name >
Specifies the name of the driver as reported by the
.B strsetup -c
command.  This field is used to match the names read by the
.B strsetup
command from the kernel and must match exactly (the match is case sensitive).
.TP
.RB < filename >
Specifies the full path name of the character special file or files to be
created when
.B driver_name
is configured into the kernel.  The
.I filename
can contain one conversion specifier in the style of
.BR printf (3).
This conversion specifier is used to include a minor device number in the
filename.  The permitted conversions are the following:
.RS
.IP \fB%d\fR
Prints the minor number as a signed decimal.
.PD 0
.IP \fB%x\fR
Prints the minor number as hexadecimal with lower case letters.
.IP \fB%X\fR
Prints the minor number as hexadecimal with upper case letters.
.IP \fB%o\fR
Prints the minor number as octal.
.IP \fB%u\fR
Prints the minor number as an unsigned decimal.
.IP \fB%i\fR
Prints the minor number as a signed decimal.
.PD
.PP
Note that you must use a double percent sign (%%) to include a percent sign in
the filename.  Optionally, each of these conversions can include a
specification for some number of leading 0's.  This is done by following %
with a 0 and one or more digits specifying the total number of digits to be
printed.  The 0 must appear after the %.  See
.BR printf (3)
for more information.  Any directories in the path of the filename that do not
exist are created.
.RE
.TP
.RB < file_mode >
Specifies the file mode assigned to the file when it is created.  The
.I file_mode
field must be in octal.
.TP
.RB < minor_number >
Specifies the minor device number field.  The
.B strsetup
command reads the major device numbers from the kernel.  This field indicates
to the
.B strsetup
command how to assign minor device numbers.  The
.I minor_number
field can contain one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B clone
Indicates that the device should be created as a clone device.  In this case
the major number becomes that of the special
.BR clone (4)
pseudo-device driver and the minor device number becomes the device's major
number.  Note that the word \(lqclone\(rq must be lower case.
.TP
.B N
Creates a single device with the minor device number
.IR N .
Note that
.I N
is a decimal number.
.TP
.B M-N
Creates
.IR M - N
nodes with the devices' major numbers and minor numbers between
.IR M " and " N .
Note that
.IR M " and " N
are decimal numbers.  When a range of minor numbers is specified, a filename
conversion specifier can be used to make certain that each node created is
unique.
.RE

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1)
indicates that an error occurred and a diagnostic message is printed to
.BR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message
is printed to
.BR stderr .
.PP
Errors can result from inadequate permissions, inability to open the
.BR nuls (4)
driver, inability to push the
.BR sc (4)
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B strsetup -i
should be run by the system at boot time.  This creates the device special
files for any new
.I STREAMS
modules.
.PP
The
.B strsetup
command requires that the
.BR sc (4)
.I STREAMS
module and the
.BR nuls (4)
.I STREAMS
driver.  It either one is not available, the
.B strsetup
command will not be successful.
