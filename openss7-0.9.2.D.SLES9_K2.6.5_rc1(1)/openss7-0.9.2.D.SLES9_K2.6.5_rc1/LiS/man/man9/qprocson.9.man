.\"

.SH NAME
.B qprocson, lis_qprocson
\- enables a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue for multi-processing
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void qprocson(queue_t *" rq );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I rq
the read queue of the queue pair for which to turn on queue procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
enables the invocation of put and service procedures for the queue pair whose
read queue pointer is pointed to by
.IR rq .
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
should be called before returning from the
.BR qopen (9)
procedure and before passing any messages with
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putnext (9),
invoking callbacks with
.BR mi_bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9)
or
.BR qtimeout (9)
and before executing
.BR qwait (9)
or
.BR qwait_sig (9).
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is provided so that a module or driver
.BR qopen (9)
procedure is able to prepare
.BR put (9)
and
.BR srv (9)
procedures from the open routine before the
.BR put (9)
and
.BR srv (9)
procedures are invoked by upstream stream head, modules or drivers on either
queue in the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
is always successful.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
can be called from any
.BR !in_irq ()
context including user context, queue procedures, call-outs, callbacks, but
must not be called from an interrupt service routine.
.PP
.BR qprocsoff ()
must be called by the
.BR qclose ()
procedure (i.e. in user context) before returning.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.BR qprocson ()
must be called with the queue-pair read queue, otherwise only the write queue
will have processing turned on.  This is probably a bug.
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
must be called with a valid read queue pointer for a queue pair.
.BR qprocson ()
must not be called on a stream that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
Before a call to
.BR qprocson ()
a driver or module is only partially attached to a stream.  With procedures
turned off, any upstream or downstream module calling
.BR putnext (9)
will bypass the module.
After the explicit (or implicit) call to
.BR qprocson ()
the driver or module is fully inserted into the stream.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qprocson ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and system based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following porting considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR qprocson ()
sets the
.I QHLIST
flag in the
.BR queue (9)
structure for both queues in the queue pair.
.BR qprocson ()
can be called repeatedly for the same queue pair and only the first call will
have an effect.  This can crash or lock processors on other systems (with the
exception of
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
as described below.)
.IP \(em
Although
.BR qprocson ()
is supposed to be called before returning from the
.BR qopen (9)
procedure,
on systems that support it,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
performs an implicit
.BR qprocson ()
upon return from
.BR qopen (9)
in the case that
.BR qprocson ()
was not called before return.
.IP \(em
.BR qprocson ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR qprocson ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR qprocson ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
