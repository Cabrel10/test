.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.PP
.TP \w'count\ \ 'u
.I q
the write-side queue pointer passed to the write-side queue put or service procedure from which
.BR miocnak ()
is called.
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block from the input output control operation to be processed, normally passed into the
write-side queue put or service procedure.
.TP
.I count
the count of the number of bytes of data contained in the attached message block.
.TP
.I error
the error number to return from the
.BR ioctl (2)
call in
.BR errrno (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
transforms the passed in
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message block,
.IR mp ,
into a
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message block to be passed upstream by the caller.
The count and error set in the resulting
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message will be set to
.IR count " and " error .
.BR miocnak ()
replies to the read-side queue before returning.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
is used in processing of
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
and
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
messages when performing
.BR ioctl (2)
processing in a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedures.  It is used to negatively acknolwedge the
completion of a
.BR ioctl (2)
operation and return an error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
returns
.BR void .
The passed in message block,
.IR mp ,
is passed upstream and the caller must reliquish its reference to the message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
always succeeds; however, when passed an invalid pointer or argument,
.BR miocnak ()
has indeterminate results and could destabilize the kernel or cause immediate or delayed panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
can be called from any context; however, it is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive access to the passed
in message block.  This is normally the case when
.BR miocnak ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure with a message block that was passed to those
procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
is implemented by adjusting the necessary data structures and then passing the resulting message
block upstream using
.BR qreply (9).
.\"

.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR miocnak ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR miocnak ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
For maximum portability, the message blocks and structures should be manipulated directly using
standard
.I STREAMS
utilities in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR miocnak ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR miocnak ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR miocnak ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
