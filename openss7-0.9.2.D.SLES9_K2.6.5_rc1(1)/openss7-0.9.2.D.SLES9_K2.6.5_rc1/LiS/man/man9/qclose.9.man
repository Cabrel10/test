.HP 8
.BI "int qclose(queue_t *" q ", int " flag ", cred_t *" credp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the read queue of the queue pair to close.
.TP
.I flag
the flags that were provided to the
.BR qopen (9)
procedure.
.TP
.I credp
the credentials of the caller.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR qclose ()
closes a
.I STREAMS
module or driver by calling the queue's
.I qi_qclose
procedure.
.BR qclose ()
is invoked on the last close of a
.I STREAMS
character special file.
.PP
.I q
is a pointer to the module or driver's read queue.
.PP
.I flag
is a close flag and is one of the following:
.PP
.I credp
is a pointer to a credentials structure indicating the credentials of the
process invoking the close, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf

typedef int o_uid_t;
typedef int o_gid_t;
typedef unsigned char uchar;

typedef struct cred {
    uid_t cr_uid;                               /* effective user id */

In addition, any error returned by the module's
.I q->q_info->qi_close
function can be returned by
.BR qclose ().

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qclose ()
should only be called from user context or from within a
.BR qopen (9)
or
.BR qclose (9)
procedure.
