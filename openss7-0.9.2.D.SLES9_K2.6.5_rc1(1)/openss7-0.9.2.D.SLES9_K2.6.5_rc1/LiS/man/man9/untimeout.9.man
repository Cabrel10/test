.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP 8
.BI "toid_t untimeout(toid_t " tid );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I tid
the timeout identifier to cancel.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
stops a timer previously started with
.BR timeout (9).
.I tid
is the timer identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR timeout (9).
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is typically used to stop timers before they expire, and to deallocate timers
before a stream is closed.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
returns a
.B timo_t
defined as follows:
.sp
.nf
typedef int toid_t;
typedef int timeout_id_t;
.fi
.PP
The return value from
.BR untimeout ()
is undefined and ignored.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
fails silently
.IR "" ( retval
is ignored) when
the timer associated with the timer identifier
.I tid
no longer exists or is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Because the module is permitted to unload after calling
.BR untimeout ()
for all outstanding buffer callbacks the call to
.BR untimeout ()
will not return until either the callback function has completed, or the
callback function has been cancelled.  Therefore the callback function will be
guaranteed not to run once 
.BR untimeout ()
has returned for all outstanding callbacks.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
provides a wrapper to Linux Kernel timer functions to implement
.BR timeout ().
.BR LiS 's
implementation
.[
LiS
.]
creates a Linux timer structure, assigns it a sequential
integer timer identifier, and places it in a timer list.
Whenever
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
stops a timer, it checks the list for the integer timer identifier with
interrupts disabled.  This is an exhaustive linear search.  This is
inefficient.
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers that stop timers often will experience poorer performance
than if the Linux kernel timer facility was used
directly.
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
can be called with a
.I toid
returned by
.BR timeout (9).
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
must be called for all outstanding timeout calls from the
.BR qclose (9)
procedure of the modules before exiting and unloading.
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
must be called promptly for outstanding timeouts.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Unfortunately,
under
.IR LiS ,
.[
LiS
.]
.BR untimeout ()
returns immediately when a callback is being executed without cancelling the callback.  This makes
the function rather unusable on
.IR LiS .

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[
svr4spg
.]
with the following portability considerations:

The
.IR UnixWare \(rg
function prototype returns

Under

.BR timeout (9)
creates a Linux timer structure, assigns it a sequential integer timer
identifier, and places it in a timer list.  Whenever
.I LiS
stops a timer, it
checks the list for the integer timer identifier with interrupts disabled.
This is an exhaustive linear search.  This is inefficient.
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers that stop timers often will experience poorer performance
than if the Linux kernel timer facility was used directly.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
.[

.]
describes this function as accepting an
.B int
.I bcid
and returning an
.B int
return value.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
describes this function as having the following prototype:
.sp
.nf
.BI "clock_t untimeout(timeout_id_t " toid );
.fi
.sp
The
.B clock_t
return value is described as being -1 when the
.I toid
is not found and zero or positive otherwise.
.IP \(em
Both
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfdoc
.]
have different prototypes for
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR untimeout (9)
when used for
.I STREAMS
as when used for other drivers.  The prototypes for
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR untimeout (9)
for use by
.I STREAMS
are the old
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3spg
.]
definitions which use an
.B int
for the
.BR toid_t .
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
