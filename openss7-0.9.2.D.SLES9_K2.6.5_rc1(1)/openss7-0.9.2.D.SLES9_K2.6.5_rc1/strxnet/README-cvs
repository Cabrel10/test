The following is an extract from the manual to assist CVS developers:

5.1.6 Downloading from CVS
--------------------------

If you are a subscriber or sponsor of The OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) with CVS archive access privileges then you can
download release or mid-release versions of the `strxnet' package from the
project CVS archive.

The OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package is located in the `strxnet' subdirectory
of `/var/cvs'.  For release tag information, see *Note Releases::.

To access the archive from the project CVS pserver, use the following commands
to check out a version from the archive:

     % export CVSROOT='-d:pserver:USERNAME@cvs.openss7.com:2401/var/cvs'
     % cvs login
     Password: *********
     % cvs co -r strxnet_0.9.2.9 strxnet
     % cvs logout

It is, of course, possible to check out by date or by other criteria.  For more
information, see *Note cvs(1): (*manpages*)cvs(1).

 Preparing the CVS Working Directory
....................................

Although public releases of the `strxnet' package do not require
reconfiguration, creating a configurable directory from the CVS archive
requires tools not normally distributed with the other releases.

The build host requires the following GNU tools:

   * `autoconf 2.59'
   * `automake 1.9.6'
   * `libtool 1.5.22'
   * `gettext 0.14.5'

It should be stressed that, in particular, the `autoconf' and `automake' must
be at version releases `2.59' and `1.9'.  _The versions normally distributed in
mainstream GNU/Linux distributions are, in fact, much older than these
versions._(1)  GNU version of these packages configured and installed to default
directories will install in `/usr/local/' allowing them to coexist with
distribution installed versions.

For building documentation, the build host also requires the following
documentation tools:

   * `gs 8.15'
   * `tetex 3.0'
   * `texinfo 4.8'
   * `transfig 3.2.5'
   * `imagemagick 6.2.4'
   * `groff 1.17.2'

Most desktop GNU/Linux distributions will have these tools; however, some
server-style installations (e.g. `Ubuntu'-server) will not and they must be
installed separately.

For uncooked manual pages, the entire `groff' package is required on `Debian'
and `Ubuntu' systems (the base package does not include grefer which is used
extensively by uncooked manual pages).  The following will get what you need:

     Debian: % apt-get install groff_ext
     Ubuntu: % apt-get install groff

In addition, the build host requires a complete tool chain for compiling for the
target host, including kernel tools such as `genksyms' and others.

If you wish to package rpms on an `rpm' system, or debs on a `dpkg' system, you
will need the appropriate tool chain.  Systems based on `rpm' typically have
the necessary toolchain available, however, `dpkg' systems do not.  The
following on a `Debian' or `Ubuntu' system will get what you need:

     % apt-get install debhelper
     % apt-get install fakeroot

To generate a configuration script and the necessary scriptlets required by the
GNU `autoconf' system, execute the following commands on the working directory:

     % autoreconf -fiv strxnet

where, `strxnet' is the name of the directory to where the working copy was
checked out under the previous step.  This command generates the `configure'
script and other missing pieces that are normally distributed with the release
Tar Balls, SRPMs and DSCs.

Make sure that `autoreconf --version' returns `2.59'.  Otherwise, you may need
to perform something like the following:

     % PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     % autoreconf -fiv strxnet

After reconfiguring the directory, the package can then be configured and built
using the same instructions as are used for the Tar Ball, see *Note Configuring
the Tar Ball::, and *Note Building from the Tar Ball::.

Do note, however, that `make' will rebuild the documentation that is normally
released with the package.  Additional tools may be necessary for building the
documentation.

When configuring the package in a working directory and while working a
change-compile-test cycle that involves configuration macros or documentation, I
find it of great advantage to invoke the GNU `configure' options
`--enable-maintainer-mode' and `--enable-dependency-tracking'.  The first of
these two options will add maintainer-specific targets to any generated
`Makefile', and the later will invoke automatic dependency tracking within the
`Makefile' so rebuilds after changes to macro, source or documentation files
will be automatically rebuilt.
