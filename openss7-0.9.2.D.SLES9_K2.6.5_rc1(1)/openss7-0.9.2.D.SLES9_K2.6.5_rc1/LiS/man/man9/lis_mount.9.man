.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mount ()
is an
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
wrapper function to the system call
.BR mount (2)
that can be called from the kernel.
.PP
The purpose of this function being called from the kernel is to permit STREASM
kernel modules to mount their own filesystems.  Normally a file system would
be mounted by a
.I STREAMS
module or driver when the
.B Linux
kernel module is initialized (i.e. within the
.BR init_module ()
function), and unmounted using
.BR umount (9)
within the kernel module
.BR cleanup_module ()
function.
.PP
The arguments to
.BR mount ()
are the same as to the user system call
.BR mount (2).
.PP
.I specialfile
is the name of the device to mount.
.PP
.I dir
is the directory point at which to attach the file system.
.I filesystemtype
is the file system type for
.IR specialfile .
.I mountflags
are the flags used to specify options for mounting the file system.
.I mountflags
can be as follows:
.TP 16
.B MS_RDONLY
mount the file system read only.
.PD 0
.TP 16
.B MS_NOSUID
ignore suid and sgid bits.
.TP 16
.B MS_NODEV
refuse access to device special files.
.TP 16
.B MS_NOEXEC
do not permit program execution.
.TP 16
.B MS_SYNCHRONOUS
writes are synchronized immediately.
.TP 16
.B MS_REMOUNT
change the flags for an existing mounted file system.
.TP 16
.B MS_MANDLOCK
permit mandatory locks.
.TP 16
.B MS_NOATIME
do not change the access times on files.
.TP 16
.B MS_NODIRATIME
do not change the access times on directories.
.TP 16
.B MS_BIND
bind the subtree elsewhere.
.PD
.PP
.I data
is an argument that is interpreted differently depending on the file system
type.
.PP
For additional information, see
.BR mount (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR mount ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR mount ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR mount ()
fails, it returns a negative error number that can contain any of the errors
listed under
.BR mount (2).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mount ()
must be called from user (process) context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mount ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mount ()
is implemented by changing the data segment to the kernel data segment and
calling
.BR mount (2).
This means that the
.BR uid " and " euid
of the caller is not changed.
This makes this function rather useless if the process invoking it is not the
kernel module loading daemon, or other process running with real root
permission.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR mount (2),
.BR lis_umount2 (9),
.BR lis_mknod (9),
.BR lis_unlink (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Under GCOM releases of
.IR LiS ,
.BR moutn ()
will not function and will panic the kernel on architectures that do not have a simple call
interface for system calls (e.g. parisc).
.PP
Previous and current OpenSS7 releases of
.I LiS
do not have this problem.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mount ()
is compatible with
.BR mount (2).
