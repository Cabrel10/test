.SH NAME

\- finds an autopush list entry for a given \fISTREAMS\fP device number
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/stropts.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/sad.h>
.HP
.BI "int autopush_vml(struct str_mlist *" smp ", int " nmods );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I smp
a pointer to a
.B str_mlist
structure containing the list of module names to verify.
.TP
.I nmods
the number of module names in the
.B str_mlist
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
performs the same function within the kernel as is provided to user space via
the
.B SAD_VML
IO control to the
.BR sad (4)
.I STREAMS
Adminstrative Driver.
This function verifies that a module list is valid (loaded on the system).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
is a
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" -specific
function.
.BR autopush_vml ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  Instead, the
user-space
.I STREAMS
autopush utility
.BR sad (8)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR autopush_vml ()
returns zero (9) to indicate that all of the modules in the specified module
list are loaded on the system.
Upon failure,
.BR autopush_vml ()
returns one (1) if an invalid name is present in the list, or returns a
negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
fails and returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'\ [EINVAL]\ 'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I nmods
is less than one (1).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
can only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
is MP-safe.
The caller is responsible to ensure exclusive access to the passed in
module list,
.IR smp .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
has the side effect that if a \fISTREAMS\fP module corresponds to a
kernel-module, the call will load the kernel module: meaning, this function
has the side effect of calling
.BR request_module (9)
for some of the module names in the module list, whether the control is
successful or not.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR autopush_vml ()
has no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.

specific function and should not be used by portable \fISTREAMS\fP modules and
drivers.
