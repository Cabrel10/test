.HP
.BI "int unregister_strdrv(struct cdevsw *" cdev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to the
.I STREAMS
character device switch table entry,
.BR cdevsw (9),
to unregister.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
unregisters the character device switch table entry,
.IR cdev ,
from the character device switch table.
.PP
Historically, under
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
the character device switch table was a fixed-sized array indexed on major device number.  With
expanded major device number, a fixed-size array would be to consumptive of pinned memory.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses a file system directory approach instead.
Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
each
.I STREAMS
device driver is allocated a directory entry in the
.IR "STREAMS Special Shadow File System" ,
.BR specfs (5).
Special
.B inode
numbering is used in the
.BR specfs (5),
where the major component of the
.B inode
number is zero
.RB ( 0 ),
and the minor component of the
.B inode
number is the module id (internal major device number) of the driver.  Each registered
.I STREAMS
device driver has a directory
.B inode
in the
.BR specfs (5).
Lookups are performed by looking up an
.B inode
on the
.BR specfs (5)
by
.B inode
number.
See
.BR specfs (5)
for additional details.
.PP
The
.I cdev
entry must contain a
.I d_name
member.
Othersize,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EINVAL ].
.PP
The
.I cdev
entry must have previously been registered with a call to
.BR register_strdrv (9),
otherwise,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ ENXIO ].
.PP
The
.I cdev
entry must not have any external major device nodes that remain allocated with
.BR register_xnode (9);
minor device nodes that remain allocated with
.BR register_strnod (9);
autopush entries allocated with
.BR autopush_add (9),
or via the
.BR sad (4)
driver; nor active stream heads;
otherwise,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EBUSY ].
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is probably not the function that you want.  See
.BR unregister_strdev (9).
.PP
.BR register_strdrv (9)
is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
driver initialization routine
.RB ( __init "() or " module_init "() procedure)
to publish the driver to the
.I STREAMS
executive and the
.BR specfs (5)
file system, making the driver available to user space scripts and programs to
.BR open (2s)
the device driver via the
.BR specfs (5).
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
driver termination routine
.RB ( __exit "() or " module_exit "() procedure)
to remove the driver from the
.I STREAMS
executive and the
.BR specfs (5)
file system, making the driver no longer available to user space scripts and programs to
.BR open (2s)
the device driver via the
.BR specfs (5).
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
is used to unregister a
.I STREAMS
device driver.
.I STREAMS
device drivers registered with
.BR register_strdrv (9)
must be unregistered with
.BR unregister_strdrv (),
using the same
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure,
.IR cdev ,
that was passed to
.BR register_strdrv (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0).
Upon failure,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
takes no action and returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
fails and returns a negative error number.
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
can fail under the following conditions:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The
.I cdev
structure or its members are invalid or contain invalid information.  (See text.)
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
The
.I cdev
supplied is not registered.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The
.I cdev
supplied is still in use with an allocated major device node, minor device node, autopush entry, or
active stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
can be called from any blocking context, including user context, kernel thread context, module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures, and some top level
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures; however, it is only intended to be called from a driver or module
.BR __exit ()
or
.BR moddule_exit ()
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
is MP-safe, when called from the correct context.  The caller must ensure exclusive access to the
passed in
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure,
.IR cdev ,
and its associated linked structures.

.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP

device drivers registered with
.BR register_strdrv (9)
in a driver or module initialization routine, must be unregistered with

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv (9)
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
specific de-registration function that should not be used directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers.
See
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
for a function that can be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers.
.PP

.BR STREAMS (9)
