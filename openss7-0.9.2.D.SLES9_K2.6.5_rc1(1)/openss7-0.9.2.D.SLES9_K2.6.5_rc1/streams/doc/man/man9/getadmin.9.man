Module ID.

.SH INTERFACE

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getadmin ()
returns a pointer to the administration function as indicated by the
.I qi_qadmin
member of the
.BR qinit (9)
structure for the module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Returns a pointer to the administration function for that module, or
.B NULL
if no driver or module has the given identifier.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR getadmin ()
fails it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR getadmin ()
fails when there is no driver or module for the given module Id.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR getadmin ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
When called from a blocking context,
.BR getadmin ()
has the side-effect that the identified module may be loaded by module
identifier.  The kernel module demand loaded will have the module name or
alias
.RB \*(lq streams-modid-\fI%u\fP \*(rq,
where
.RI \*(lq %u \*(rq
is the identifier of the
.I STREAMS
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR getadmin ()
is MP-save; however, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the
driver or module has not unloaded before dereferencing the resulting function
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR getadmin ()
first searches the character device table
.RB ( cdevsw )
for a
.I STREAMS
device with the same module identifier, then the pushable
.I STREAMS
module table
.RB ( fmodsw ).
.PP
The module identifier is held in the
.I mi_idnum
member of the
.BR module_info (9)
structure pointed to by the
.I qi_minfo
of the
.B qinit (9)
structure, which is usually hard coded for each driver or module.  The module
identifier should be a unique number for each device or module.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR getadmin ()

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getadmin ()
is compatible with
.I "SVR 4.2"
.[
svr4spg
.]
and systems based on
.I "SVR 4.2"
such as
.IR AIX \(rg,

.IR LiS \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,

.IP \(em
Under

.[

.I mid
is of type
.BR modID_t ,
which reduces to
.BR ushort .
.IP \(em

.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
