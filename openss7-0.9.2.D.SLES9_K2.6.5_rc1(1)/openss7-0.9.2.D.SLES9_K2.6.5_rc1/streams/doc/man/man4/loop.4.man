.SH NAME

\- \fISTREAMS\fP loop-around pseudo-device driver
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B loop
psuedo-device multiplexing driver is an implementation of the loop-around driver described in the
.RI \(lq "UNIX\(rg System V Release 4 \- STREAMS Programmer's Guide" ,\(rq
.[
svr4spg
.]
with a number of exceptions and enhancments.  The primary purposes of the
.B loop
pseudo-device driver are: to provide a capability to the
.BR test-streams (8)
conformance and verification test program, for testing passing of STREAMS file descriptors across a
pipe-like driver;
and to provide an example of a pipe-like driver for the STREAM programmer.
To avoid complications for testing, and to serve as a basic example, the driver is as simplistic as
possible.
.PP
The
.B loop
pseudo-device driver has the following behaviour:
.TP 3n
.B "open\fR(2s)"
When a
.B loop
STREAM is opened using
.BR open (2s)
a new
.B loop
STREAM is created.  The newly created STREAM is not associated with any other STREAM.
Issuing the
.B LOOP_SET
input-output control is necessary, to associate the loop STREAM with another one,
before data can be written to or read from the STREAM.  Any attempt to send data on the STREAM
before it is associated with another will result in an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message being sent upstream causing all further read, write or control operations on the stream to
fail with error
.RB [ ENXIO ].
.TP
.B LOOP_SET
The
.BR LOOP_SET
input-output control described under
.RI \(lq IOCTLS ,\(rq
below, is used to connect the upstream and downstream flow between the requesting STREAM and a
specified STREAM.  Once connected in this fashion, data can be passed in either direction.
.TP
.B "putpmsg\fR(2s), \fPgetpmsg\fR(2s)"
Data is passed in either direction using the
.BR putpmsg (2s)
or
.BR getpmsg (2s)
calls as normal.  The
.B loop
driver coordinates
.I STREAMS
flow control across the driver by explicitly enabling service procedures of the feeding side when
the accepting side is back-enabled.
.TP
.B "close\fR(2s)"
When an STREAM is closed using the
.BR close (2s)
system call, the STREAM is dismantled.
If the upper STREAM remains connected to another STREAM (due to a previous call to
.BR LOOP_SET ),
the connection will be broken and a
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
message will be sent to the other STREAM.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B loop
pseudo-device loop-around driver is an implementation of the loop-around driver described in the
.RI \(lq "UNIX\(rg System V Release 4 \- STREAMS Programmer's Guide" ,\(rq
.[
svr4spg
.]
with a number of considerations as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
The
.I SVR4
driver does not implement input-output controls other than
.BR LOOP_SET .
In contrast,
.B loop
implements a set of input-output controls compatible with the
.I LiS
.[
lis
.]
loop-around driver for use in testing.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.TP
.B LOOP_SET
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.B loop
driver is used by the
.BR test-streams (8)
conformance and verification test program to test passing of file descriptors across a
pipe-like driver.  Much of its behaviour is specific to testing and cannot be altered without
impacting the ability of the
.BR test-streams (8)
conformance and verification test program results.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B loop
is implemented as described in the
.IR "SVR4 SPG" .

.SH COMPATIBILITY

provides the
.B loop
pseudo-device driver for testing and compatibility with
.IR LiS ,
.[
LiS
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Although this driver is described in the
.IR "SVR4 SPG"
.[
svr4spg
.]
as a driver example, most
.I STREAMS
implementations do not actually provide such a driver.
.IP \(em
.B loop
is provided primarily for use by the
.BR test-streams (8)
conformance and verification test program, and as an example of a pipe-like driver with flow
control supported across the driver.  It should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules, driver or applications programs.
