.TP
.I name
The name of the driver or module.
.TP
.I inst_major
Specifies the major device number for a
.I STREAMS
device.  If this field is coded
.BR -1 ,
then a device major will be automatically assigned.

.I inst_str_tab
The current stream tab entry.
.TP

Install flags.
See

.I inst_sync_level
The

synchronization level.

The

.SS "Install Flags"
.PP
This can be a bitwise or of the following:
.TP
.B STR_IS_DEVICE
The
.I STREAMS
driver to install is a device.
.TP
.B STR_IS MODULE
The
.I STREAMS
module to install is a module.
.TP
.B STR_TYPE_MASK
Mask of
.B STR_IS_DEVICE
and
.BR STR_IS_MODULE .
.TP
.B STR_SYSV4_OPEN
V4 open signature and return.
.TP
.B STR_QSAFETY
Module needs safe callback functions.
.TP
.B STR_IS_SECURE
Module/device is secure.
.\"
.SS "Synchronization Levels"
.PP
The
.I STREAMS
synchronization level.
as follows:
.TP
.B SQLVL_DEFAULT
Default level of synchronization.
Specifies that the module uses the default synchronization scheme.  This is
the same as specifying
.BR SQLVL_MODULE .
.TP
.B SQLVL_GLOBAL
.I STREAMS
scheduler level synchronization.
Specifies that the module is run with global synchronization.  This means that
only one
.I STREAMS
executive thread will be permitted to entry any module.  This makes the entire
.I STREAMS
executive single threaded and is useful primarily for debugging.  This is the
same as
.RI \(lq "Uniprocessor Emulation" \(rq
on some systems, and reduces the
.I STREAMS
executive to running on a single processor at a time.
.TP
.B SQLVL_ELSEWHERE
Module group level synchronization.
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization within a group of
modules.  Only one thread of execution will be within n the group of modules
at a time.  The group is separately specified as a character string name.
This permits a group of modules to run single threaded as though they are
running on a single processor, without interfering with the concurrency of
other modules outside the group.  This can be important for testing and for
modules that implicitly share unprotected data structures.
.TP
.B SQLVL_MODULE
Module level synchronization. (Default)
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the module.  Only one
thread of execution will be permitted within the module.  Where the module
does not share data structures between modules, this has a similar effect to
running on a UP system.  This is the default and works best for non-MP-safe
modules written in accordance with
.I STREAMS
guidelines.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUEPAIR
Queue pair level synchronization.
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue pair.  Only
one thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures within a
given queue pair.  Where the read and write side of the queue pair share the
same private structure
.IR ( q->q_ptr ),
this provides MP protection of the common data structure to all synchronous
entry points without an external semaphore.
.TP
.B SQLVL_QUEUE
Queue level synchronization.
Specifies that the module is run with synchronization at the queue.  Only one
thread will be permitted to enter a given queue's procedures, however, another
thread will be permitted to enter the procedures of the other queue in the
queue pair.  This is useful when the read and write side of a module are
largely independent and do no require synchronization between sides of the
queue pair.
.TP
.B SQLVL_NOP
No synchronization.
Specifies that the module is run without synchronization.  All synchronous
module entry points, call-outs and callbacks become asynchronous.  It is the
module's responsibility to provide synchronization or serialization as
required.

.BR str_install ()
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS

.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_HPUX
or

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR str_install ()
is compatible with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Synchronization flags and fields used by

in the
.B streams_info_t
structure are compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" .

.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR str_install ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR HP-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR HP-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs

differ from that of
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR str_install ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR HP-UX \(rg

drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by

in support of

devices are not supported.
