.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B copyresp
structure is one of a set of
.BR ioctypes (9)
structures including
.BR iocblk (9),
.BR copyreq (9),
and
.BR copyresp (9),
that are used for communicating between the
Stream head
or an internal driver or module using
.I STREAMS
messages.  The messages used and the placement of these structures into messages is illustrated in
the table below:

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
Functions that operate on the
.B copyresp
structure can be called from any context.  However, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that
the calling thread has exclusive access to the
copy response structure.
When the
copy response structure
is contained in an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message that has just been removed from a
.BR queue (9)
in a
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of the queue,
copy response structure
exclusivity is normally guaranteed.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
Functions that access the
.B copyresp
structure are MP-safe.  However, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure exclusive access to the
structure before altering any of the members of the structure.
.PP
Because the copy response structure is normally stored in a
.I STREAMS
message, see
.BR datab (9)
for additional information.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B iocblk
structure is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP EFT" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR Solaris \(rg
documents the
.I cp_flag
member.
.[
soldoc
.]
.IR IRIX \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
do not document the
.I cp_flag
member.
.[
suxspg
.]
.[
uw7spg
.]
.[
uxpspg
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not access the
.I cp_flag
member.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documents the
.I cp_uid
and
.I cp_gid
fields for
.IR "SCO OpenServer" \(rg
compatibility.
.I cp_uid
and
.I cp_gid
were present in
.IR "SVR 3.2" .
.[
svr3
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not use the
.B cp_uid
nor
.B cp_gid
macros and will not attempt to access the old
.I "SVR 3.2"
members.
.IP \(em
The order and size of the various members of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure, and the associated aligned
.BR copyreq (9)
and
.BR copyresp (9)
structures, vary in
.I STREAMS
from implementation to implementation.  Some implementations have different structure definitions
depending upon the word size of a specific architecture.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
follows the
.IR "SVR 4.2"
implementation as closely as possible.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not rely upon a specific overall size of the
.BR copyresp (9)
structure, or the offset or alignment of any of its members.
.IP \(em
Lining up these input-output control block data structures is tedious and uninteresting.  See
.BR ioctypes (9)
for more information.
Various implementations exhibit various alignments.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not rely upon alignment of any fields except the first three fields of each
structure, and the alignment and preservation of the
.I cq_private
and
.I cp_private
fields.
That is all that is guaranteed by the
.IR "SVR 4.2 SPG" .
