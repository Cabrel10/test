.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvuderr(int " fd ", struct t_uderr *" err );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to receive a unit data error.
.TP
.I err
a pointer to a
.B t_uderr
structure to contain returned information about the received error.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
receives a unitdata error indication that arrived on the local transport
endpoint specified by
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which the unitdata error
indication arrives.
.PP
.I err
points to a
.B t_uderr
structure that returns the destination address and options associated with the
original message and the error code.
The
.B t_uderr
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_uderr {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        t_scalar_t error;               /* error code */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_uderr
structure returns the following members and information:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the destination address of the original unitdata that
resulted in the unitdata error indication.
The
.I err->addr.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I err->addr.len
is significant on return.
If
.I err->addr.maxlen
is zero on call, no destination address is returned.
If
.I err->addr.len
is zero on return, no destination address was associated with the unitdata
error indication.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns the options associated with the original unitdata that
resulted in the unitdata error indication.
The
.I err->opt.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I err->opt.len
is significant on return.
If
.I err->opt.maxlen
is zero on call, no options are returned.
If
.I err->opt.len
is zero on return, no options were associated with the original unitdata that
resulted in the unitdata error indication.
.TP
.I error
the error code value is transport service provider specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_IDLE .
.PP
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
is valid only for transport service providers for service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
will block until a unitdata error indication is received.
In asyncronous mode when no unitdata error indication is immediately
available,
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNOUDERR .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
returns zero (0) and the destination address, options and error code in the
.B t_uderr
structure.
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvuderr ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call
.IR "" ( addr ", " opt )
was non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can happen when the transport service provider is of type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .
.TP
.RB [ TNOUDERR ]
An attempt was made to read a unitdata error and no unitdata error indication was available and
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set using
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcntl (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.RB [R T_IDLE .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.BR errno (3).
