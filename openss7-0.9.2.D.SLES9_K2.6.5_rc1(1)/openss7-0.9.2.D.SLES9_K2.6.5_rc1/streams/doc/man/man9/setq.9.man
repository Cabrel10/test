the queue for which to set sizes and procedures;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR setq ()
sets the queue parameters for the read and write queues of the queue pair
indicated by the read queue pointer,
.IR q ,
to the read initialization information specified by
.IR rinit ,
and the write initialization information specified by
.IR winit .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR setq ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR setq ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR setq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR setq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR setq ()
is used internally by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler when creating a new queue pair for a driver or module to set the
parameters associated with each queue in the queue pair from the driver or
module
.BR streamtab .
It is also used by the
.I STREAMS
stream head when linking streams under a multiplexing driver to set the lower
multiplexer queue parameters against the stream head queue pair.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR setq ()
has no known bugs.
