/* 2006-02-20 bidulock@openss7.org : This is really, really, the wrong way to do this.  I cannot
 * stress how wrong this is.  This does not provide 32/64 bit compatibility at all.  It simply
 * attempts to turn a 32 bit call into a 64 bit call an passes it to the kernel.  A big problem is
 * the pointer conversion (32->64), which is architecture specific.  (Some need (void
 * *)(long)(int32_t), some need (void *)(ulong)(uint32_t), others might need to supply an offset.)
 * For example of how wrong this is: applications built on s390 using static libraries will not run
 * on s390x.  The proper way to do this is as it is done under Linux Fast-STREAMS: leave the library
 * alone and handle the conversion in the kernel.  When performed by syscall, the syscall32
 * interface must perform the conversion.  When performed by read/write call, the "magic length"
 * must indicate whether conversion is necessary.  When performed by ioctl, the 32/64 bit ioctl
 * conversion functions must do the job.  I really have no desire to "fix" LiS in this regard.  It
 * is deprecated: don't use it.  Use Linux Fast-STREAMS instead. */
