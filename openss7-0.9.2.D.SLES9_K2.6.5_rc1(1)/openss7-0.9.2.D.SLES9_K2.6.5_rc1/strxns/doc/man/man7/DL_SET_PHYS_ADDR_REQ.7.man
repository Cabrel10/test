.SH NAME
.B DL_SET_PHYS_ADDR_REQ (dl_set_phys_addr_req_t)
\- sets the physical address value for all streams for that provider for a
particular PPA.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of
.B M_PROTO
message block which contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_addr_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_addr_offset;
} dl_set_phys_addr_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_SET_PHYS_ADDR_REQ
sets the physical address value for all streams for that provider for a
particular PPA.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_SET_PHYS_ADDR_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.TP
.I dl_addr_length
conveys the length of the requested hardware address.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any attached state in which a local
acknowledgement is not pending.  For a Style 2 provider, this would be after
a PPA is attached using the
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7).
For a Style 1 provider, the PPA is implicitly attached after the stream
is opened.
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged
.SH RESPONSE
The provider responds to the request with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
on successful completion.  Otherwise, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The address information was invalid or was in an incorrect format.
.TP
.B DL_BUSY
One or more streams for that particular PPA are in the
.B DL_BOUND
state.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is known, but not supported by the DLS Provider.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
