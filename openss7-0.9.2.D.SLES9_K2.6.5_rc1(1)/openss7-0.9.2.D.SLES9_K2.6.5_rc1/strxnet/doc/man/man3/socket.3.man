.SH NAME
.B socket
\- create an endpoint for communication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int socket(int " domain ", int " type ", int " protocol );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR socket ()
function creates an unbound socket in a communications
domain, and returns a file descriptor that can be used in later
function calls that operate on sockets.
.PP
The function takes the following arguments:
.TP
.I domain
Specifies the communications domain in which a socket is to be
created.
.TP
.I type
Specifies the type of socket to be created.
.TP
.I protocol
Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
Specifying a protocol of 0 causes
.BR socket ()
to use an
unspecified default protocol appropriate for the requested
socket type.
.PP
The domain argument specifies the address family used in the
communications domain.  The address families supported by the system
are implementation-dependent.
.PP
Symbolic constants that can be used for the domain argument are
defined in the <sys/socket.h> header.
.PP
The type argument specifies the socket type, which determines the
semantics of communication over the socket.  The socket types
supported by the system are implementation-dependent.  Possible
socket types include:
.TP
.B SOCK_STREAM
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode
byte streams, and may provide a transmission mechanism for
out-of-band data.
.TP
.B SOCK_DGRAM
Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode, unreliable
messages of fixed maximum length.
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode
transmission path for records.  A record can be sent using one
or more output operations and received using one or more input
operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more
than one record.  Record boundaries are visible to the receiver
via the
.B MSG_EOR
flag.
.PP
If the protocol argument is non-zero, it must specify a protocol
that is supported by the address family.  The protocols supported by
the system are implementation-dependent.
.PP
The process may need to have appropriate privileges to use the
.BR socket ()
function or to create some sockets.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The documentation for specific address families specify which
protocols each address family supports.  The documentation for
specific protocols specify which socket types each protocol
supports.
.PP
The application can determine if an address family is supported by
trying to create a socket with domain set to the protocol in
question.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR socket ()
returns a nonnegative integer,
the socket file descriptor.  Otherwise a value of -1 is returned and
.IR errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR socket ()
function will fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EAFNOSUPPORT ]
The implementation does not support the specified address
family.
.TP
.RB [ EMFILE ]
No more file descriptors are available for this process.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
No more file descriptors are available for the system.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTONOSUPPORT ]
The protocol is not supported by the address family, or the
protocol is not supported by the implementation.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTOTYPE ]
The socket type is not supported by the protocol.
.PP
The
.BR socket ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
The process does not have appropriate privileges.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform
the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient
.IR STREAMS (4)
resources available for the
operation to complete.
