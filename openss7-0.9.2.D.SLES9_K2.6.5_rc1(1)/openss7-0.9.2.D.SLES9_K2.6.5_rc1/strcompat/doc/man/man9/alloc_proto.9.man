.HP

.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I psize
the size of the control part of the message.
.TP
.I dsize
the size of the data part of the message.
.TP
.I type
the message type of the control part of the message.
.TP
.I bpri
the priority of the requested message buffers.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
allocates two message blocks, one to contain a control message and another to
contain a data message.  The control part of the message is of
type
.I type
and size
.IR psize .
The data part of the message is of
type
.BR M_DATA (9)
and of size
.IR dsize .
Both buffers are requested with priority
.IR bpri .
The data message will be linked after the control message using the
.I b_cont
member of the control (initial) message block.
.PP
The
.I bpri
can be one of the following values:
.sp
.TS
expand tab(:);
lb0ls.
BPRI_LO\ \ :requests low priority message buffers.
BPRI_MED\ \ :requests medium priority message buffers.
BPRI_HI\ \ :requests high priority message buffers.
BPRI_WAITOK\ \ :block for low priority message buffers.
.TE
.PP
If
.BR alloc_proto ()
is called with a
.I bpri
other than
.BR BPRI_LO ", " BPR_MED ", " BPRI_HI " or " BPRI_WAITOK ,
the request will be treated as
.BR BPRI_LO .
.PP
The
.I bpri
argument is ignored by many
.IR SVR 4
based implementations.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
is an
.I SVR 3
function.
.B _SVR3_SOURCE
must be defined before including
.I STREAMS
header files to expose the prototype for this function.
Also,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must have been compiled with kernel configuration parameter
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_SVR3_COMPAT
defined.
.PP
Priority
.B BPRI_WAITOK
is added for
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfdoc
.]
compatibility and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
is an
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
remnant and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers should not rely on the behaviour of the implementation in
response to a particular setting of the
.I bpri
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR alloc_proto ()
returnes a
.BR mblk_t (9)
pointer to the allocated message blocks.  The first allocated message block will have
a data block type of
.I type
and a size of
.IR psize ;
the second allocated message will have a data block type of
.BR M_DATA (9)
and a size of
.IR bsize .
All bands and flags will be cleared on both message and data blocks.
.IR b_rptr " and " b_wptr
will be set to the beginning of the data block buffer a read for both control
and data message blocks.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR alloc_proto ()
will return a
.B NULL
message pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR alloc_proto ()
will fail and return a
.B NULL
message pointer.
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
will only fail if there is insufficient memory to allocate the necessary
data structures for the message blocks, data blocks or data buffers, for the
given values of
.IR psize ", " bsize " and " bpri .
.PP
Failure to allocate a message block is typically followed by a call to
.BR bufcall (9),
or a related callback.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
The priority
.B BPRI_WAITOK
must only be used in a call from a blocking context (i.e. user context).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
is a
.IR "SVR 3" -specific
function:
.B _SVR3_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR3_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
performs two separate calls to 
.BR allocb (9)
to acquire the necessary buffers.  If the second call to
.BR allocb (9)
fails, the first buffer is freed.
.PP
See
.BR allocb (9)
for a discussion on the use and implementation of
.IR bpri .
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
will fail to allocate a combined message data block
under the same circumstances as
.BR allocb (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR alloc_proto ()
is compatible with
.I SVR 3 STREAMS
.[
svr3spg
.]
and
systems based on
.IR "SVR 3" ,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
This is not a
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
.[
usldk
.]
function.
.IP \(em
.IR xSTRa \(rg
.[
xstra
.]
provides this function, but initializes
.I b_wptr
to point to the end of each data buffer.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility information.
