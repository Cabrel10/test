.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
helper function that can be used to generate a message block, with possible reuse of an existing
message block.
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
can optionally be passed a queue pointer,
.IR q ,
representing the write-side queue from which to generate an
.BR M_ERROR (9)
reply with error number
.B ENOSR
should the allocation of a new message block fail.  If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is
.B NULL
and an error occurs,
.BR mexchange ()
will fail silently and return
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
can optionally be passed a message block pointer,
.IR mp ,
referencing a message block that may be resued to generate the requested message block.
If the passed in message block pointer is
.BR NULL ,
then an attempt will be made to allocate a new message block with priority
.BR BPRI_LO .
If the passed in message block,
.IR mp ,
cannot be reused, it will be freed (using
.BR freemsg (9))
and an attempt will be made to allocate a new message block.
If the passed in message block is reused, yet has additional message blocks attached to
.I b_cont
pointer, then those additional message blocks will be freed.
The passed in message block,
.IR mp ,
will also not be used if the size of the message block is smaller than
.IR size ;
if the number of references to the data block is greater than one (that is, the message block has
been duplicated with
.BR dupb (9));
or, if the message block was allocated with
.BR esballoc (9).
In all cases where a passed in message block is not reused, it will be freed.  The caller must
relinquish its reference on the passed in message block(s).
When the message block is resused, it will be restored to a form as though it were just allocated
using
.BR allocb (9)
with size,
.IR size ,
and priority
.BR BPRI_LO .
.PP
The returned message block will have its
.I db_type
set to
.IR type ;
and the
.I b_wptr
will be adjusted to reflect the
.I size
of the message block.  If the passed in primitive type,
.IR primtype ,
is non-negative, and there is sufficient room provided by
.I size
to accomodate a
.BR t_scalar_t ,
then the primitive type will be set in the leading
.B t_scalar_t
of the data block.

.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
is used when avoiding the generation of buffer calls using
.BR bufcall (9).
.PP
In general, buffer calls using
.BR bufcall (9)
should be used instead of the rather dubious practice of attempting to reuse message blocks.
This practice may permit a
.I STREAMS
module or driver to continue in the face of a system buffer leak that has exhausted the buffer pool;
however, it is still dubious.
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
has the even more noxious behavior that it is not possible for the caller to tell whether a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message has been generated upstream or not when a
.RB non- NULL
.I q
pointer was passed and a
.B NULL
pointer is returned.  This makes it rather unusable for use in conjunction with
.BR bufcall (9),
(unless
.B NULL
is always passed as
.IR q ),
and requires the caller to record the fact that
.BR mexchange ()
returned
.B NULL
and take aditional actions.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mexchange ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the allocated or resued message block;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL ,
and possibly generates a
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message upstream with
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
fails when no message block is passed in, or the passed in message block,
.IR mp ,
is unusable, and a new message block could not be allocated.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
can be called from any non-interrupt context, but is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
message block.  This is normally the case when
.BR mexchange ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure and the passed in message pointer is that which
was passed into the procedure.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mexchange ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mexchange ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Direct allocation and manipulation of the message blocks using standard
.I STREAMS
utility functions should be performed in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mexchange ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mexchange ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mexchange ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
