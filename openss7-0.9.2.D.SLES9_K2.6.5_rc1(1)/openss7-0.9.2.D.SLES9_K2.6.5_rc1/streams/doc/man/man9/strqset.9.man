.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to set values.
.PD 0
.TP
.I what
what values of the associated queue to set.
.TP
.I band
the band for the specified settings.
.TP
.I val
the value to set.
.PD
.\"

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR strqset ()
sets the attribute requested by
.I what
for the queue pointed to by
.I q
and band specified by
.I band
to the value specified by
.IR val .
The value set can be either a scalar or a pointer.
.PP
When
.I band
is zero,
.BR strqset ()
will set the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue.
When
.I band
is non-zero (between 1 and 255),
.BR strqset ()
will set the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue band specified by
.IR band .
.PP
The argument
.I what
specifies the queue (or queue band if
.I band
is non-zero) attribute to be set.
.I what
can be one of the following values.
.TP \w'QMAXPSZ\(em'u
.B QHIWAT
Sets the high water mark associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.PD 0
.TP
.B QLOWAT
Sets the low water mark associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QMAXPSZ
Sets the maximum packet size associated with the
.IR q .
For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).
.TP
.B QMINPSZ
Sets the minimum packet size associated with the
.IR q .
For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).
.PD
.PP
.BR strqset ()
provides a mechanism whereby a
.IR STREAMS (4)
driver or module can change information
about a queue or queue band without directly accessing the
.B queue
or
.B qband
structures.
Values set by
.BR strqset ()
are equivalent to directly accessing the
.B queue
or
.B qband
structure members described below.
.PP
The
.B queue
structure contains at least the following members:
.HP
.BI "size_t " q_hiwat
\- the high water mark for the queue.
.PD 0
.HP
.BI "size_t " q_lowat
\- the low water mark for the queue.
.HP
.BI "ssize_t " q_maxpsz
\- the maximum message size accepted by the queue.
.HP
.BI "ssize_t " q_minpsz
\- the minimum message size accepted by the queue.
.PD
.PP
The
.B qband
structure contains at least the following members:
.HP
.BI "size_t " qb_hiwat
\- the high water mark for the band.
.PD 0
.HP
.BI "size_t " qb_lowat
\- the low water mark for the band.

.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR strqset ()
returns zero (0) and sets the appropriate attribute to the appropriate value;
upon failure, a non-zero error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR strqset ()
fails, the requested attribute remains unchanged, and
it returns one of the following errors:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.BR QMAXPSZ " or " QMINPSZ
was specified for
.I what
and
.I band
was non-zero;
.I what
is not a valid queue or queue band attribute.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
the queue band specified in
.I band
does not exist and a
.BR qband (9)
structure could not be immediately allocated.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
.I what
specified an attribute that is appropriate for
.BR strqget (9),
but which is invalid for
.BR strqset ():
.BR QCOUNT ", " QFIRST ", " QLAST " or " QFLAG .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR strqset ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR strqset ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Calling
.BR strqset ()
on a queue and stream previously frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
could result in single-party deadlock.

as a function that can only be passed a queue in the queue pair currently
being synchronized within a module procedure.

also lists
.BR strqset ()
as a utility that cannot be called from user functions or
.RI non- STREAMS
code; that is, contexts asynchronous to the Stream containing
.IR q .
.IP ""
.IR HP-UX \(rg
compatible drivers and modules will not call
.BR strqset ()
from outside of a

routine for the queue pair of
