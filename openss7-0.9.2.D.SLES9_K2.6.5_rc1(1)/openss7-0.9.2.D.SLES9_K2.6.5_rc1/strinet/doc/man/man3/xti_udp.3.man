.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual section describes the protocol-specific information that is
relevant for UDP transport providers.  This section also describes the
protocol-specific information that is relevant when UDP services are provided
over an IP network using UDP.
.PP
This section also defines the data structures and constants required for UDP
transport providers that are exposed through the
.B <xti_udp.h>
header file.
.\"
.\"
.SH "ADDRESS FORMAT"
.PP
The UDP address format is structured as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t         sin_family;  /* Address family */
    unsigned short int  sin_port;    /* Port number */
    struct in_addr      sin_addr;    /* Internet address */
    /* padding */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.B sockaddr_in
structure contains the following members:
.TP \w'sin_family\(em'u
.I sin_family
The address family.  Always set to
.BR AF_INET " or " AF_UNSPEC .
.PD 0
.TP
.I sin_port
The port number of the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I sin_addr
The IP address of the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I (padding)
Padding to pad the size of the
.B sockaddr_in
structure to the size of a
.B sockaddr
structure.
.PD
.PP
The structure is padded to the size of a
.BR sockaddr
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are formatted according to the
.B t_opthdr
structure as described in
.BR xti (3).
An UDP transport provider compliant to this specification supports none, all
or any subset of the options defined here.  An implementation may restrict the
use of any of these options by offering them only in a priviledged read-only
mode.
.PP
An UDP transport provider supports three levels of options.  These three levels
are described below.
.\"
.\"
.SS "XTI_GENERIC"
.PP
Options with this level are specific to the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI/TLI)
and are common to all transport providers.  For more information see
.BR xti (3).
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B XTI_GENERIC
are as follows:
.TP
.B XTI_DEBUG
Sets debugging flags for the stream.
This option is formatted as an array of
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are implementation defined.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_LINGER
Sets whether, and the amount of time if, the stream will linger waiting for
unsent data to be delivered.
This option is formatted as a
.B t_linger
structure as follows:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_linger {
    t_scalar_t l_onoff;   /* option on/off */
    t_scalar_t l_linger;  /* linger time */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'l_linger\(em'u
.I l_onoff
Specifies whether to linger
.RB ( T_YES )
or not
.RB ( T_NO ).
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
.TP
.I l_linger
Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to linger.
Legal values are
.BR T_INFINITE ", " T_UNSPEC
and all positive numbers including zero.
.PP
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.RE
.TP
.B XTI_RCVBUF
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the receive buffer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_RCVLOWAT
Specifies the low water mark above which received data will be indicated and
delivered to the user.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_SNDBUF
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the transmit buffer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.B XTI_SNDLOWAT
Specifies the low water mark above which queued data will be transmitted to
the peer.
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
Legal values are all positive, non-zero numbers.
For more information, see
.BR xti (3).
.\"
.\"
.SS "T_INET_IP"
.PP
Options within this level are specific to the Internet Protocol (IP) and are
common to all the protocol levels in IP.  For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B T_INET_IP
are as follows:
.TP
.B T_IP_OPTIONS
Provides control for the T_IP OPTIONS field.  Used for debugging.
This option is formatted as an array of
.BR "unsigned char" ,
up to 40 elements.
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_TOS
Provides control of the type-of-service byte present in each transmited T_IP
packet.
This option is formated as an
.BR "unsigned char" .
Legal values can be generated with the
.BR SET_TOS ()
macro described in
.BR xti_ip (3).
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_TTL
Provides control of the time-to-live byte present in each transmitted T_IP
packet.
This option is formatted as an
.BR "unsigned char" .
Legal values are from 0 to 255.
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_REUSEADDR
Allows multiple non-listening binds to the same address.
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_DONTROUTE
Bypasses routing tables and routes directly to an interface.  Used for
debugging.
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.TP
.B T_IP_BROADCAST
Allows broadcast addresses to be used.  This option is not applicable to TCP
and is always set to
.BR T_NO .
This option is format as a
.BR "unsigned int" .
Legal values are
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
For more information, see
.BR xti_ip (3).
.\"
.\"
.SS "T_INET_UDP"
.PP
Options within this level are specific to the User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) yet are used by protocol levels using UDP transport.
.PP
The options defined with the option level
.B T_INET_UDP
are as follows:
.TP
.B T_UDP_CHECKSUM
This option allows disabling/enabling of the
.B T_UDP
checksum computation.  The legal values are
.B T_YES
(checksum enabled) and
.B T_NO
(checksum disabled).
.sp
If this option is returned with
.BR t_rcvudata (3),
its value indicates whether a checksum was present in the received datagram or
not.
.sp
Numerous cases of undetected errors have been reported when applications
choose to turn of checksums for efficiency.  The advisability of ever turning
off the checksum algorithm is very controversial.
.sp
This option is formatted as a
.BR t_uscalar_t .
It can take on values
.BR T_YES " and " T_NO .
This option is an
.IR "absolute requirement" .
This option is of
.IR "end-to-end significance" .
