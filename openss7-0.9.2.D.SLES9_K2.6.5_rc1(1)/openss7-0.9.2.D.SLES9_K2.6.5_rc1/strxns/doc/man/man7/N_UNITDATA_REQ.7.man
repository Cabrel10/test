.SH NAME
.B N_UNITDATA_REQ, N_unitdata_req_t
\- unitdata request
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the NS provider send the specified datagram to
the specified destination.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks.  The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_UNITDATA_REQ */
    ulong DEST_length;          /* destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;          /* destination address offset */
    ulong RESERVED_field[2];    /* reserved field for DLPI
                                   compatibility */
} N_unitdata_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I DEST_length
Indicates the length of the destination address.

.TP
.I DEST_offset
Indicates the offset of the destination address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I RESERVED_field
This is a reserved field (for compatibility with
.BR dlpi (7))
whose value must be set to zero for both entries of the array.
.SH STATE
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR NS_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The resulting state remains unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
.HP
.B Successful:
There is no acknowledgment for the successful completion of this primitive.
.HP
.B Non-Fatal Error:
If a non-fatal error occurs, it is the responsibility of the NS provider to
report it via the
.BR N_UDERROR_IND (7)
primitive.
.HP
.B Fatal Error:
Fatal errors are indicated via an
.B M_ERROR
.I STREAMS
message type (issued to the NS user with the
.IR errno (3)
value of
.BR EPROTO ),
which results in the failure of all Linux system calls on the stream.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The following non-fatal error codes are allowed:
.TP
.RB [ NBADADDR ]
The network address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect format,
or the address contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ NBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was outside the range supported by
the NS provider.
.TP
.RB [ NOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.PP
The fatal errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.IP \- 4
The network service interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
.IP \-
The amount of NS user data associated with the primitive defines a network
service data unit larger than that allowed by the NS provider.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
