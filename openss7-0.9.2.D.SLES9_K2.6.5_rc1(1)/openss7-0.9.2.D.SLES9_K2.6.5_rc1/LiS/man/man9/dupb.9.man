.SH NAME
.B dupb, lis_dupb
\- duplicate a \fISTREAMS\fR message block
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "struct msgb *dupb(struct msgb *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message block to duplicate.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR dupb ()
generates a new copy of the message block which references the same data block
as the passed in data block.  The
.IR b_wptr " and " b_rptr
pointers of the new message block are set to the same values as the duplicated
message block.  The data block remains untouched.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR dupb ()
returns a pointer to the duplicated message block.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR dupb ()
returnes a
.B NULL
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR dupb ()
fails, it returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.BR dupb ()
can fail because the passed in message point,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
or, the new message block cannot be allocated.
Normaly if
.BR dupb ()
fails,
.BR esbbcall (9)
should be called with the
.I priority
associated with the message for which duplication failed.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR dupb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR dupb ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure
exclusive access to the passed in message block.  On return, the caller has
the only reference to the returned message block.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR dubp ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR dupb ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI,
.IR Solaris \(rg
and LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
When
.BR dupb ()
is passed a
.B NULL
.I bp
pointer, the results are undefined.  When LiS
.BR dupb ()
is passed a
.B NULL
.I bp
pointer, it returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
