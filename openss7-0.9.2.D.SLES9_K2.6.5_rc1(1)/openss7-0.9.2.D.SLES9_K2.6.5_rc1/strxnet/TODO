Things to do:

* The XTI/TLI library is now largely in maintenance mode.  Not much
  special development is planned.

- Full ATM Support.  This is an item where the XTI implementation is
  lacking.  When we provide full TPI ATM support under the strss7
  package, then this item will be investigated.

- Addition of a (unfortunately non-standard) send with options commands
  for SCTP.

  *done*

    Actually this was already done a long time ago.  See manual pages
    t_sndopt(3), t_sndvopt(3), t_rcvopt(3) and t_rcvvopt(3).  Perhaps
    what needs to be done is to test them?
