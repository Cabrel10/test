.SH NAME
.B DL_XID_RES (dl_xid_res_t)
\- conveys an XID DLSDU from the DLS User to the DLS Provider in response to a
.BR DL_XID_IND (7).
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by zero or more
.B M_DATA
blocks containing zero or more bytes of data.  The message structure is
as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_flag;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_offset;
} dl_xid_res_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_XID_RES
conveys an XID DLSDU from the DLS User to the DLS Provider in response to a
.BR DL_XID_IND (7).
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_XID_RES .
.TP
.I dl_flag
conveys the flag values associated with the received XID frame.
.RS
.TP
.B DL_POLL_FINAL
indicates if the poll/final bit is set.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address of the destination DLS User.  If the
destination user is implemented using DLPI, this address is the full DLSAP
address returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where
the destination DLSAP address begins.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in states
.B DL_IDLE
and
.BR DL_DATAXFER .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
On a invalid XID response request, a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is issued to the usr.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The DLSAP address information was invalid or was in an incorrect
format.
.TP
.B DL_BADDATA
The amount of data in the current DLSDU exceeded the DLS Provider's
DLSDU limit.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is known but not supported by the DLS Provider
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A System error has occurred and the Linux System error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B DL_XIDAUTO
Previous bind request specified Provider would handle XID.
