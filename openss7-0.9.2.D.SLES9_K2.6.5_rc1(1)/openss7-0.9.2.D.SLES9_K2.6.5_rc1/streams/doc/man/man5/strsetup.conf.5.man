.SH NAME
.B strsetup.conf
\- configuration file for \fISTREAMS\fR drivers
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B /etc/strsetup.conf
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B /etc/strsetup.conf
file is the configuration file for
.I STREAMS
drivers. The
.B strsetup.conf
file specifies one or more character special files (or nodes) to be created
when a
.I STREAMS
driver is configured into the kernel.  If the driver is not configured, no
character special files are created for it.  If an old version of the file
exists, the
.BR strsetup (8)
command removes it before the new one is created.
.\"
.\"
.SS "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
Each entry in the
.B strsetup.conf
file specifies a driver name, device special file name, file mode and minor
number.  See the \*(lq\fIEXAMPLES\fP\*(rq section for a sample
.B strsetup.conf
file.
.PP
Each line in the file is of the form:
.HP
.RB < driver_name "> <" filename "> <" file_mode "> <" minor_number >
.PP
The fields have the following meanings:
.TP
.RB < driver_name >
Specifies the name of the driver as reported by the
.BR strsetup (8)
command.  This field is used to match the names read by the
.BR strsetup (8)
command from the kernel and must match exactly (the match is case sensitive).
.TP
.RB < filename >
Specifies the full path name of the character special file or files to be
created when
.RI < driver_name >
is configured into the kernel.
The filename can contain one conversion specifier in the style of
.BR printf (3).
This conversion is used to include a minor device number in the filename.  The
permitted conversions are the following:
.RS
.IP \fB%d\fR
Prints the minor number as a signed decimal.
.IP \fB%x\fR
Prints the minor number as hexadecimal with lower case letters.
.IP \fB%X\fR
Prints the minor number as hexadecimal with upper case letters.
.IP \fB%o\fR
Prints the minor number as octal.
.IP \fB%u\fR
Prints the minor number as an unsigned decimal.
.IP \fB%i\fR
Prints the minor number as a signed decimal.
.PP
Note that you must use a double percent sign (%%) to include a percent sign in
the filename.  Optionally, each of these conversions can include a
specification for some number of leading 0's.  This is done by following %
with a 0 and one or more digits specifying the total number of digits to be
printed.  The 0 must appear after the %.  See
.BR printf (3)
for more information.  Any directories in the path of the filename that do not
exist are created.
.RE
.TP
.RB < file_mode >
Specifies the file mode assigned to the file when it is created.  The
.I file_mode
field must be in octal.
.TP
.RB < minor_number >
Specifies the minor device number field.  The
.B strsetup
command reads the major device numbers from the kernel.  This field indicates
to the
.B strsetup
command how to assign minor device numbers.  The
.I minor_number
field can contain one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B clone
Indicates that the device should be created as a clone device.  In this case
the major number becomes that of the special
.BR clone (4)
pseudo-device driver and the minor device number becomes the device's major
number.  Note that the word \(lqclone\(rq must be lower case.
.TP
.B N
Creates a single device with the minor device number
.IR N .
Note that
.I N
is a decimal number.
.TP
.B M-N
Creates
.IR M - N
nodes with the devices' major numbers and minor numbers between
.IR M " and " N .
Note that
.IR M " and " N
are decimal numbers.  When a range of minor numbers is specified, a filename
conversion specifier can be used to make certain that each node created is
unique.

is an

file format is also
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provides
