.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int msgsize(mblk_t *" mp ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
the message to count message bytes.

.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
counts the size of all of the blocks in the message pointed to by
.IR mp ,
regardless of type.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
is used internally to count the size of messages place on and taken off of
message queues.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR msgsize ()
returns the number of bytes in the message pointed to by
.IR mp .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR msgsize ()
returns zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
fails and returns zero (0) when
the message pointer
.I mp
is
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves) and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
is MP-safe.
It is the responsibility of the caller, however, to ensure validity of reference and exclusive
access to the passed in message.
See
.BR mp-streams (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
specific helper function provided by the base
.I "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
package.  The
.I STREAMS Compatibility Modules
.BR strcompat (5)
package is not required for this symbol to be access.
It is not necessary to define
.B _SUN_SOURCE
or to include
.RB < sys/strsun.h >
to access this symbol.
However, portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not access this function.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
has no known bugs.
.\"

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR msgsize ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
soldoc
.]
and
.I LiS
.[

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR msgsize ()
is an implementation specific utility provided by
.IR Solaris \(rg
where it is made accessible by including the
.RB < sys/strsun.h >
header file.
.BR msgsize ()
is also provided by
.IR LiS .
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not access this function.
.IR Solaris \(rg
compatible
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules may access this function.
.IP \(em
The
.IR Solaris \(rg
implementation
can produce invalid sizes because it does not check whether
.I b_wptr
is less than
.IR b_rptr .
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
does not reproduce this
.IR Solaris \(rg
behaviour and will treat negative length message blocks as zero length.
.IP ""
.IR Solaris \(rg
compatible
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will never pass messages where the difference between
.I b_wptr
and
.I b_rptr
pointers is negative.
.IP \(em
.BR msgsize ()
counts the size
.RI ( b_wptr  " - " b_rptr )
of all blocks in the message.
.I LiS
counts the absolute size
.RI ( db_lim " - " db_base )
of all blocks in the message.
This is particularly broken verion of the
.IR Solaris \(rg
helper function.
The worst problem with this is that
.I LiS
uses this broken
.BR msgsize ()
to do all queue and queue band accounting: meaning that queue counts have nothing to do with the
size of message blocks, just the size of data buffers.  That is completely inconsistent with any
.I STREAMS
implementation and does not conform to
.IR "SVR 4" .
