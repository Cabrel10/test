.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _MAC_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/macddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void mi_attach(queue_t *" q ", caddr_t " ptr ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
A pointer to the module or driver's read queue, obtained directly from
.BR qopen (9).
.TP
.I ptr
A pointer to the module or driver instance data.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.BR qopen (9)
or
.B I_LINK
procedure to attach the instance data to the queue.
The instance data must have been previously allocated using
.BR mi_open_detached (9).
The instance data must later be freed using
.BR mi_close_comm (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_attach (9)
is typically used in conjunction with
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
and
.BR mi_close_detached (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
fails it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
can be called from blocking context and should only be called from a module or driver's
.BR qopen (9)
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.  The caller must ensure exclusive access to the
passed in instance data and queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.

.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_attach ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_attach ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_attach ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_attach ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_attach ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
