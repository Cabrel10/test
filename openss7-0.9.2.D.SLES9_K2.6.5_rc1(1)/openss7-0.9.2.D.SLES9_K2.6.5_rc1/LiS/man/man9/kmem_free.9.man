.SH NAME
.B kmem_free, lis_kmem_free
\- deallocates kernel memory
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/kmem.h>
.HP
.BI "void kmem_free(void *" ptr ", size_t " size );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to the memory to free.
.I size
the size of the memory to free.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Deallocates the memory previously allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).
.PP
As a side-effect of freeing memory allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9),
.BR kmem_free ()
also causes outstanding buffer calls to be scheduled.
.BR kmem_free ()
checks the
.I strbcwait
system flag to see if there are buffer calls waiting.  If the
.I strbcwait
flag is set,
.BR kmem_free ()
sets the
.I strbcalls
flag to tell the
.I STREAMS
scheduler to run buffer callbacks on the next run of
.BR runqueues ()
and sets the
.I qrunflag
to indicate to the system that
.BR runqueues (9)
should be executed as soon as possible.
This is consistent with the procedure described for
.BR kmem_free (9)
under SVR 4.

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
If
.BR kmem_free ()
fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
can be called in any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
This is simply implemented in
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with Linux
.BR kfree ().
.I LiS
ignores the
.I size
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kmem_alloc (9),
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
Older version of
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
use
.B int
as the type of the
.I size
argument, instead of
.BR size_t .
Current versions ignore the
.I size
argument altogether.
This can often cause a compiler warning for and unused variable.  Always cast your size variable to
.RB ( void )
to stop compiler warnings.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
and
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Under LiS,
.BR kmem_free ()
ignores the
.I size
argument and frees memory using
.BR lis_mfree()
which always calls
.BR kfree (9).
.I LiS
does not properly schedule buffer calls in accordance with
SVR 4.2.
.IP \(em
.BR kmem_free ()
is implemented as a function call.
.I LiS
implements
.BR kmem_free ()
as a macro.
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
