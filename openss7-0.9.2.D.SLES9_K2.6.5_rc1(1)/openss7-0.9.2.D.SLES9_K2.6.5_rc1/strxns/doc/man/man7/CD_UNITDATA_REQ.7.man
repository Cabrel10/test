.TH CD_UNITDATA_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Communications Device Interface (CDI)"
.SH NAME
.B CD_UNITDATA_REQ
\- data send request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks.
The
.B M_PROTO
message block is structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
.\"/*
.\" * CD_UNITDATA_REQ, optional M_PROTO type, with M_DATA block(s)
.\" */
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ushort cd_addr_type;
    cd_ushort cd_priority;
    cd_ulong cd_dest_addr_length;
    cd_ulong cd_dest_addr_offset;
} cd_unitdata_req_t;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the specified data be sent to the
specified destination address with the specified priority.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_addr_type
.RS
.TP
.B CD_SPECIFIC
Specifies that an address is contained in the primitive.  When
.I cd_addr_type
is set to
.BR CD_SPECIFIC ,
a destination address must be specified in the
.I cd_dest_addr_length
and
.I cd_dest_addr_offset
fields.
.TP
.B CD_BROADCAST
Specifies that the data is to be sent to the implicit broadcast address and no
specific address follows.  When
.I cd_addr_type
is set to
.BR CD_BROADCAST ,
the fields
.I cd_dest_addr_length
and
.I cd_dest_addr_offset
should be coded zero (0) and are ignored by the CD provider.
.TP
.B CD_IMPLICIT
Specifies that an implicit address is to be used, or that the address is
embedded in the data.  When
.I cd_addr_type
is set to
.BR CD_IMPLICIT ,
the fields
.I cd_dest_addr_length
and
.I cd_dest_addr_offset
should be coded zero (0) and are ignored by the CD provider.
No address or embedded address.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_priority
Specifies the priority of the data.  Priorities are provider- and
device-specific.
.TP
.I cd_dest_addr_length
When
.I cd_addr_type
is
.BR CD_SPECIFIC ,
this field specifies the length of the destination address to which to send the
message.  Otherwise, this field is coded zero (0) and ignored by the CD
provider.
.TP
.I cd_dest_addr_offset
When
.I cd_addr_type
is
.BR CD_SPECIFIC ,
this field specifies the offset of the destination address from the start of
the
.B M_PROTO
message block.  Otherwise, this field is ignored by the CD provider.
.SS State
This primitive is valid in states
.BR CD_ENABLED ,
.BR CD_INPUT_ALLOWED ,
.BR CD_OUTPUT_ACTIVE ,
.BR CD_READ_ACTIVE .
The state remains unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires an acknowledgement under the following conditions:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When field
.I cd_output_style
in
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7)
is set to
.BR CD_ACKEDOUTPUT ,
then the provider is required to acknowledge the
.B CD_UNITDATA_REQ
with a
.BR CD_UNITDATA_ACK (7).
Otherwise, the primitive does not require an acknowledgement.
In either case, the state remains unchanged.
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider is required to acknowledge the primitive with
a
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive indicating the error.
.SH ERRORS
