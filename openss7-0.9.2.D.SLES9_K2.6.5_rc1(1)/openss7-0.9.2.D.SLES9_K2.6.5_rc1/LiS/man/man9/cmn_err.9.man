.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/cmn_err.h>
.HP 8
.BI "cmn_err(int " err_lvl ", char *" fmt ", " ... );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I err_lvl
the error level to report.
.TP
.I fmt
a
.BR printf (3)
format string.
.TP
.I ...
the arguments to complete the format string.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
prints a command error message to kernel log files at the level specified by
.I err_lev
and with the
.BR printk ()
formatted format string
.I fmt
and associated variable arguments.
.PP
.I err_lvl
may be one of the following values:
.TP 12
.B CE_CONT
This level indicates to continue printing.
.TP 12
.B CE_NOTE
This error level is for notices.  Notices are important events which should be
logged.
This equates to a
.B KERN_NOTICE
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP 12
.B CE_WARN
This error level is for warinings.  These are critical conditions, however,
these errors do not halt the kernel.
This equates to a
.B KERN_WARNING
level in
.BR Linux .
.TP 12
.B CE_PANIC
This error level is a panic error level.  This is for highly critical errors
where the kernel has destabilized and it is necessary to halt the kernel.
.RS
.PP
When the
.I err_lvl
is specified as
.BR CE_PANIC ,
.BR cmn_err ()
will generate a
.B Linux
kernel panic with the resulting message.
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Unlike
.BR printk (),
.BR cmn_err ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
fails silently when the
.I err_lvl
is invalid or formatting of the message
per
.I fmt
and the variable arguments fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
uses
.BR printk ()
to print the messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR printk ().
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR cmn_err ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
SVR 4 systems normally print a newline at before the information provided to
.BR cmn_err ()
unless the
.B CE_CONT
flag is specified, and do not normally print a newline after the information provided to
.BR cmn_err ().
This is the opposite of BSD and Linux behavior, which print a newline at the end of the sequence
rather than the beginning.
.B LiS
can be compiled with flags providing either behavior.
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
