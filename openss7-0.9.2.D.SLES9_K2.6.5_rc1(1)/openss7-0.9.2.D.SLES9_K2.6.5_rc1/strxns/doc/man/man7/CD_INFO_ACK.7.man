.SH DESCRIPTION
This provider originated primitives acknowledges a previously issued
.BR CD_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive, and provide protocol and limits information for the stream upon
which the primitive is issued.
.PP
If the stream is in state
.BR CD_UNATTACHED ,
the information returned by
.B CD_INFO_ACK
might be different after a successful
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7)
than it was before the attach was completed.
This is because the CD provider might not yet have all protocol information
concerning the underlying communications device until after it has been
attached to a specific Physical Point of Attachment.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Indicates the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_state
Indicates the state of the CDI provider.  The
.I cd_state
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_UNATTACHED
No Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) is associated with the stream.  Only
Style 2 communications devices (streams that return
.B CD_STYLE2
in the
.I cd_ppa_style
field) can exist in this state.
.B CD_STYLE2
communications devices start in this state after
.BR open (2).
.TP
.B CD_UNUSABLE
PPA cannot be used.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLED
A Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) is associated with the stream, but the
communications device is disabled.
Style 1 communications devices (streams that return
.B CD_STYLE1
in the
.I cd_ppa_style
filed) start in this state after
.BR open (2).
.TP
.B CD_ENABLE_PENDING
A
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
has been issued and is pending.  The provider is waiting for enabling of the
communications device to complete before confirmation with
.BR CD_ENABLE_CON (7)
or error acknowledgement with
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B CD_ENABLED
The communications device is enabled and is awaiting use.  Either the input or
output must be active or allowed before data can be transferred.
.TP
.B CD_READ_ACTIVE
The input section is temporarily enabled and will be disabled after data arrives.
.TP
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
The input section is permanently enabled.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLE_PENDING
A
.BR CD_DISABLE_REQ (7)
has been issued and is pending.  The provider is waiting for disabling of the
communications device to complete before confirmation with
.BR CD_DISABLE_CON (7)
or error acknowledgement with
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B CD_OUTPUT_ACTIVE
Output section active only.
.TP
.B CD_XRAY
Xray-ing another ppa.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_max_sdu
The maximum size of a Signalling Data Unit (SDU) in octets.
.TP
.I cd_min_sdu
The minimum size of a Signalling Data Unit (SDU) in octets.
.TP
.I cd_class
Indicates the class of the communications device.
.I cd_class
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_HDLC
Bit-synchronous.
.TP
.B CD_BISYNC
Character-synchronous.
.TP
.B CD_LAN
ISO 8802-3,4,5 local-area network MAC.
.TP
.B CD_NODEV
No device, PPA used for X-ray.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_duplex
Indicates full or half duplex operation.
.I cd_duplex
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_FULLDUPLEX
Full duplex; allow input supported.
.TP
.B CD_HALFDUPLEX
Half duplex; read write/read supported.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_output_style
Indicates the output style.
.I cd_output_style
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_UNACKEDOUTPUT
The communications device does not issue
.BR CD_UNITDATA_ACK (7)
primitives.
.TP
.B CD_ACKEDOUTPUT
The communications device issues
.BR CD_UNITDATA_ACK (7)
primitives in acknowledgement of
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitives.
.TP
.B CD_PACEDOUTPUT
The communications device issues
.BR CD_UNITDATA_ACK (7)
primitives only as output timing hints.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_features
Indicates the features supported by the communications device.
.I cd_features
can be a bitwise OR of the following flags:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_CANREAD
Read request supported on full duplex.
.TP
.B CD_CANDIAL
Dial information supported.
.TP
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
as soon as enabled.
.TP
.B CD_KEEPALIVE
Don't send off at
.BR CD_DISABLE_REQ (7).
This is a Gcom extension.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_addr_length
The maximum size of an address for use with
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7),
.BR CD_UNITDATA_IND (7).
.TP
.I cd_ppa_style
Indicates the physical point of appearance style.
.I cd_ppa_style
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_STYLE1
The communications device is already attached to the physical point of
appearance at
.BR open (2).
The device starts in the
.B CD_DISABLED
state.
.TP
.B CD_STYLE2
The communications is not attached to a physical point of appearance at
.BR open (2),
and must be attached with
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7).
The device starts in the
.B CD_UNATTACHED
state.
.RE
.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state where a local acknowledgement
(requiring response with a
.BR CD_OK_ACK (7))
is not pending, and only in response to a
.BR CD_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive.
