.SH NAME

\- pull up bytes in a \fISTREAMS\fR message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "mblk_t *msgpullup(mblk_t *" mp ", int " len );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message chain to pull up.
.TP
.I len
how to pull up the message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
will copy
.I len
bytes from the message pointed to by
.I mp
into a new message, if possible, whose pointer is returned.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains more bytes than specified by
.IR len ,
.BR msgpullup ()
will copy the remaning bytes onto the end of the new message.
If the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
contains less than
.I len
bytes,
.BR msgpullup ()
fails and returns
.BR NULL .
If
.I len
is specified as -1,
all the bytes of the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
will be concatenated and copied into the new message.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR msgpullup ()
returns a pointer to the new message.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR msgpullup ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the number of bytes in the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
is less than
.IR len ;
and when allocation for the new message fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is MP-safe.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure exclusive access to
the passed in message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is a DKI replacement for
.BR pullupmsg (9).
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implementation of
.BR msgpullup ()
allocates blocks for the new message before it check to see whether the number
of bytes in the passed in message is less than
.IR len.
This is inefficient if it is normally the case that the passed in message has
less bytes than
.IR len .

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR msgpullup ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 DDI/DKI
