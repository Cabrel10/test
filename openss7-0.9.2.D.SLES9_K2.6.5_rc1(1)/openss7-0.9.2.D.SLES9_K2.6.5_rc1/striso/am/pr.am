##
## =============================================================================

#!
#! Problem Report targets:
#! -----------------------
#!
#! To ease problem report generation, all logging targets will automatically
#! generate a problem report suitable for mailing in the file 'target'.pr for
#! target 'target.log'.  This problem report file is in the form of an email
#! and can be sent directly.
#!
#! There are two additional problem report targets:
#!
#! pr:
#!     The pr target is for independently generating a problem report outside
#!     of the build or installation process.  The target will automatically
#!     generate a problem report skeleton suitable for editting and mailing in
#!     the file 'problem.pr'.  This problem report file is in the form of an
#!     email and can be sent directly.
#!
problem.pr bug pr: $(AP_CONFIG)
	$(AP_AUTOPR) --config=$(AP_CONFIG)

#! finish-pr:
#!      The finish-pr target is for finalizing a problem report.  The problem
#!      report will not be mailed but will simply have the comment lines removed
#!      from the problem report.  The target will automatically finalize the
#!      problem report in 'problem.pr'.
finish-pr:
	$(AP_AUTOPR) --config=$(AP_CONFIG) --file="problem.pr" --nomail

#! send-pr:
#!      The send-pr target is for finalizing and mailing a problem report
#!      generated either inside or outside the build and installation process.
#!      The target will automatically finalize and mail the 'problem.pr' problem
#!      report if it has changed since the last time that send-pr was run.
#!
send-pr:
	$(AP_AUTOPR) --config=$(AP_CONFIG) --file="problem.pr"
