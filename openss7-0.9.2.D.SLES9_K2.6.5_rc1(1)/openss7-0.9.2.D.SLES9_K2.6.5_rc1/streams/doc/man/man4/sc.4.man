.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <sys/stropts.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/sc.h>
.HP
.IB t " = open(" /dev/nuls ", " 0 );
.HP

.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sc
is a
.I STREAMS
configuration module for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
It interprets a set of
.B sc
.BR ioctl (2s)
commands and provides information about the streams configuration.
.B sc
does not interpret any
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO " or " M_PCPROTO
messages either from above or below the module.
.B sc
can be pushed on the the null stream
.BR nuls (4)
or any other suitable stream available to the caller (e.g.
.BR sad (4)).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B sc
module is not intended to be used directly by application program developers.
It is used by the
.BR scls (8)
utility an other utilities needing to enquire about the configuration of
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
This subsection details the
.BR ioctl (2s)
commands that are made available by pushing the
.B sc
module.  For general information on input-output controls for
.I STREAMS
drivers, see
.BR streamio (7).
.\"
.SS SC_IOC_LIST
.PP
.I arg
is a pointer to a
.BR sc_list
structure in the user's address space.
.PP
The
.B sc_list
structure contains the following members:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sc_list {
    int sc_nmods;
    struct sc_mlist *sc_mlist;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'sc_mlist\(em'u
.I sc_nmods
On call specifies the number of
.B sc_mlist
structures that a provided in the caller's buffer pointed to by
.IR sc_mlist .
On return, specifies the number of
.B sc_mlist
structures that are available to be written to the caller's buffer pointed to
by
.IR sc_mlist ,
regardless of the space provided by the caller.
.TP
.I sc_mlist
Provides a pointer to a user buffer that contains at least
.I sc_nmods
number of
.B sc_mlist
structures in an array.
The module will returns nor more than the number of modules available, or the
number of modules requested,  whichever is less.  However,
.I sc_nmods
will always return the number of modules available.
.PP
By calling with a
.I sc_nmods
of zero and a
.I sc_mlist
of
.BR NULL ,
the caller can determine the number of modules that are available to
be returned in
.IR sc_mlist
so that the buffer may be appropriately sized for a subsequent call.
.RE
.PP
The
.B sc_mlist
structure contains the following members:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct sc_mlist {
    int major;
    struct module_info mi;
    struct module_stat ms;
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'major\(em'u
.I major
Specifies the
.I major
device number for the driver whose information is contained in this entry.
.TP
.I mi
Contains the
.B module_info
structure associated with the driver with the
.I major
device number specified.
Note that if the driver definition contains more than one
.BR module_info (9)
structure in the definition, only that associated with the write side of the upper multiplexer
(i.e.,
.I st_wrinit
in
.BR streamtab (9))
will be retrieved.
For details of the
.B module_info
structure, see
.BR module_info (9).
.TP
.I ms
Contains the
.B module_stats
structure associated with the driver with the
.I major
device number specified.
Note that if the driver definition contains more than one
.BR module_stat (9)
structure in the definition, only that associated with the write side of the upper multiplexer
(i.e.,
.I st_wrinit
in
.BR streamtab (9))
will be retrieved.
For details of the
.B module_stat
structure, see
.BR module_stat (9).
.RE
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that the
.B sc
module is not yet capable of copying and providing access to the private statistics area indicated
by the
.I ms_xprt
and
.I ms_xsize
members of the
.BR module_stat (9)
structure.  This is an unnecessary limitation.
At some point it would make sense to add a
.B SC_IOC_STATS
command that would retrieve both the
.BR module_stat (9)
structure and the private statistics for a single module or driver.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Many implementations of
.I STREAMS
have some mechanism for augmenting the functionality of the
.BR sad (4)
driver.  Some implementations, such as
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.[
hpuxspg
.]
provide an
.B sc
module for this purpose.
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
provides an
.B sc
module for the purpose of allowing
.BR autopush (8)
to use device names instead of major device numbers, and to support the
.BR scls (8)
utility.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
requires the use of the
.B sc
modules with the
.BR nuls (4)
driver.
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
describes the
.B sc
module as a core
.I STREAMS
module used by
.BR autopush (8)
and provides support for device names instead of device numbers, and providing
supplemental functions for the
.BR sad (4)
driver.
.IP \(em
.B sc
can be pushed over any stream, unlike the
.IR AIX \(rg
or
.IR HP-UX \(rg
documentation.
The user must have sufficient privilege to push the
.B sc
module.
.IP \(em
Internals of the
.B sc
module is implementation dependent, not subject to standardization, and not
documented.
This manual page documents the
.B "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
implementation of the
.B sc
module.
Compatibility with other implementations is not guaranteed.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
None.  (This manual page.)
Conformance is verified using the
.BR test-sc (8)
verification test suite.
