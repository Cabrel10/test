.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I sd
a pointer to a
.BR stdata (9)
structure representing the Stream head.
.PD 0
.TP
.I sdp
a pointer to a pointer to a
.BR stdata (9)
structure representing a reference to a Stream head to release.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
provide reference counting for the
.BR stdata (9)
structure.
.BR sd_get ()
increments the reference count and returns
.IR sd .
.BR sd_put ()
decrements the reference count and nulls the pointer referenced by
.IR sdp .
If the reference count drops to zero,
.BR sd_put ()
will cause the
.BR stdata (9)
structure to be deallocated.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
are used to reference count
.BR stdata (9)
structures within the Stream head module,
.BR sth (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR sd_put ()
returns void.
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
returns the pass in
.BR stdata (9)
pointer,
.IR sd .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR sd_get ()
fails it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR sd_get ()
fails when the passed in
.BR stdata (9)
structure pointer,
.IR sd ,
is
.BR NULL .
When
.BR sd_put ()
fails it fails silently.
.BR sd_put ()
fails when the passed in structure pointer referenced,
.IR sdp ,
is
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
can be called from any context including process context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
As
.BR sd_put ()
may result in the deallocation of a
.BR stdata (9)
structure, care should be taken invoking it from an ISR.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
use atomic integer operations and are MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
are not intended to be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  They are only used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
within the
.I "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
See the source file
.I src/kernel/strsched.c
in the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution directory for implementation details.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
None.
See the source file
.I src/modules/sth.c
in the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution directory for example usage.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR stdata (9),
.BR sth (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR sd_get "() and " sd_put ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.BR sd_get ()
and
.BR sd_put ()
functions provide the ability to acquire and release reference counts on
.BR stdata (9)
structures.
These are
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
implementation specific functions not intended to be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules and not subject to standardization.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
These functions are new for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
