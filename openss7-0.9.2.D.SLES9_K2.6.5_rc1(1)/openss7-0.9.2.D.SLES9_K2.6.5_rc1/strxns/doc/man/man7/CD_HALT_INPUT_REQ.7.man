.SH NAME
.B CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ
\- halt input
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_disposal;
} cd_halt_input_req_t;

/* Actions to take with undelivered data */
#define CD_FLUSH        0x00    /* Discard undelivered data */
#define CD_WAIT         0x01    /* Attempt to deliver unsent
                                   data */

.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the input section be halted.
.PP
When a stream is enabled with
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7),
it can be used immediately for transmission.  If the stream returns
.B CD_AUTOALLOW
in the
.I cd_features
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7),
the device automatically allows input and there is no need to call
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ (7)
for the device.  However,
.B CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ
will halt input on such a device.
.PP
In addition, if the input section is temporarily enabled with
.BR CD_READ_REQ (7),
on a half-duplex communications device,
then
.B CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ
will abort the read operation.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_disposal
Specifies how unsent messages are to be disposed.  This field can be one of
the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_FLUSH
Discard undeliverable data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received will be discarded.  Any data awaiting transmission the
the device's write queue will be flushed.
.TP
.B CD_WAIT
Attempt to deliver unsent data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received the provider will attempt to send before acknowledging the
primitive.  The provider will not wait for acknowledgment of sent messages.
.TP
.B CD_DELIVER
Deliver unsent data.
All data that is unsent at the time that the
.B CD_DISABLE_REQ
primitive is received the provider will deliver before acknowledging the
primitive.  The provider will wait for acknowledgment of sent messages.
.RE
.SS State
This primitive is valid in state
.BR CD_ENABLED ,
.BR CD_INPUT_ALLOWED ", or "
.BR CD_READ_ACTIVE .
The new state is
.BR CD_ENABLED .
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires that the CD provider acknowledge receipt of the
primitive as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
Upon success, the provider will acknowledge receipt of the primitive with the
.BR CD_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.  The new state is
.BR CD_ENABLED .
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
Upon failure, the provider will acknowledge receipt of the primitive with the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive with the error inidcated in the primitive.  The new state remains
unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.B "Non-Fatal Errors:"
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADADDRESS ]
.\"Address was invalid.
.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_BADADDRTYPE ]

.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_INITFAILED ]
.\"Line initialization failed.
.TP
.RB [ CD_NOTSUPP ]
Primitive not supported by this device.
.TP
.RB [ CD_OUTSTATE ]
Primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CD_PROTOSHORT ]

.\".TP
.\".RB [ CD_WRITEFAIL ]
.\"Unitdata request failed.
.PP
.B Note:
if the communications device is in the
.B CD_ENABLED
state and the input section is not active, the
.B CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ
primitive should be ignored and no non-fatal error generated.
