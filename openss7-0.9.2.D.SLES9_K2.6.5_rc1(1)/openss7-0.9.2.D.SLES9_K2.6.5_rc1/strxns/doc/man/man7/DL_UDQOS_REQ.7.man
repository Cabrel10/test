.SH NAME
.B DL_UDQOS_REQ (dl_udqos_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider to apply the specified quality of service
parameter values to subsequent data unit transmissions.  These new values
will remain in effect until another
.B DL_UDQOS_REQ
is issued.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block containing the structure shown below.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_qos_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_qos_offset;
} dl_udqos_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_UDQOS_REQ
requests the DLS provider to apply the specified quality of service
parameter values to subsequent data unit transmissions.  These new values
will remain in effect until another
.B DL_UDQOS_REQ
is issued.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_UDQOS_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_qos_length
conveys the length, in bytes, of the requested quality of service
parameter values.  The values are conveyed in the appropriate structure
defined in
.I \*(lqQOS Data Structures,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
The available range of QOS values that may be selected is specified by the
.I dl_qos_range_length
and
.I dl_qos_range_offset
parameters in the
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive.  For any parameter whose value the DLS user does not wish to select,
the value
.B DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
may be set and the DLS provider will maintain the current value for that
parameter.  See [3]Quality of Data Link Service.  for a full description of the
quality of service parameters.
.TP
.I dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the quality of service parameters begin.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_UDQOS_PENDING .
.SH RESPONSE
If the quality of service request is successful,
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user and the resulting state is
.BR DL_IDLE .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7(
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADQOSPARAM
The quality of service parameters contained values outside the range of those
supported by the DLS provider.
.TP
.B DL_BADQOSTYPE
The quality of service structure type was not supported by the DLS provider.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
