.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This driver is used to assist LiS in implementing the
.I clone
open function.  It appears under its
own name as
.BR /dev/clone_drvr .
By convention, it is allocated the first major number of all the
.IR STREAMS (4)
drivers.

To implement clone opens, one creates a node in the
.B /dev
directory for a device whose major number is set to that of the clone driver,
and whose minor number is the major number of the driver to which the clone open
is to be directed.

The clone driver's open routine forwards the open call to the target driver,
passing a unique flag that informs the driver that a clone open is being
requested.  The target driver then allocated a minor device number to uniquely
associate with this instance of the open operation.  The clone driver
synthesizes a new major/minor
.I device id
to pass back to LiS.  LiS recognizes the change of major/minor from the original
open and takes steps to allocate control structures unique to this open.

The
.I clone open
operation is intended to make is easy to open one device from a pool of devices,
such as pseudo ttys or logical connections.  It saves application programs from
having to scan a list of device mnemonics issuing trial opens until one is found
that succeeds.

Note that the driver is named
.B /dev/clone_drvr
instead of the more traditional SVR4
.BR /dev/clone .
This is to avoid a conflict with another driver named
.B /dev/clone
on Linux systems.
