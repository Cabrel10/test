.TH PIPE 2 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ System Calls"
.SH NAME
.B pipe
\- create a \fISTREAMS\fR \fIpipe\fR
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B "#include <unistd.h> "
.HP
.BI "int pipe( int " filedes "[2] ); "
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.B filedes
a pointer to an array of two integer file descriptors into which to return the file descriptors
associated with either end of the newly created pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pipe ()
creates a
.I STREAMS
.B pipe
(see
.BR fifo "(4) "
and
.IR STREAMS "(4)), "
and provides access to its ends as a pair of file descriptors
returned in the
.I filedes
argument.
.sp
The file descriptors returned allow both read and write access
to the pipe.  Data written to one end is readable at the other,
independently in each direction;  i.e.,
.I STREAMS
pipes are not just
.IR bidirectional ,
but
.IR "full-duplex" .
.sp
Structurally, a
.I STREAMS
.B pipe
consists of a pair of
.IR "stream heads" ,
each comprising a read/write queue pair, with the write queue of each
end directed to the read queue of the other end.
The point at which this occurs is referred to as the
.I midpoint
of the pipe.
.sp
Generally otherwise, a
.I STREAMS
.B pipe
behaves as a pair of
.I STREAMS
files; e.g.,
.I STREAMS
.I modules
may be pushed onto either end, etc..
.sp
A notable exception is that
.I STREAMS
.I pipes
provide the (only) means for passing open file descriptors via the
.I STREAMS
.B I_SENDFD
and
.B I_RECVFD
.I ioctl
mechanisms.  Specifically, a file descriptor can (and must) be sent
on one end of a pipe via
.B I_SENDFD
to the other end, where it may be received via
.BR I_RECVFD .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR pipe ()
returns 0.
.\"
.\"
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR pipe ()
returns -1, and
.BR errno "(3) "
is set to indicate the error causing the failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.PP
The Linux kernel provides an independent implementation of
.IR pipes ,
corresponding to that provided before SVR4
.[
svr4
.]
used
.I STREAMS
to implement them (see 
.BR pipe "(3)). "
Although the interface is identical, the two are quite different
otherwise.
.I STREAMS
provide significant additional capability, but possibly at a lower
level of performance.
Notably,
.I STREAMS
pipes are full duplex (i.e., both ends support both read and write
access independently), and allow the use of
.I STREAMS
.I modules
to augment the processing of data.  Moreover, such processing may
be
.IR message \- oriented :
message boundaries may be established and respected by using the
.BR getmsg "(2)/" getpmsg "(2s) "
and
.BR putmsg "(2)/" putpmsg "(2s) "
primitives instead of
.BR read "(2) "
and
.BR write "(2). "
.sp
Applications wishing to use the
.I STREAMS
version of the
.BR pipe ()
function must link with the
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
library which provides it; otherwise,
the Linux kernel version will be used via the Linux/GNU C library.
.\"
.\"
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
.PP
Under Linux,
.BR pipe ()
is implemented as an
.I ioctl
operation on an anonymous
.I STREAMS
file.
An alternative system call implementation may be used in the future,
and is fact already supported within
.B LiS\c
.
.[
LiS
.]
.sp
It should be noted that no attention has yet been given to the issue
of atomic reads and writes in
.I STREAMS
pipes and fifos, common to most
implementations of these mechanisms.  This issue will be addressed
hopefully in the near future.
