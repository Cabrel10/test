.SH NAME
.B t_snddis
\- send abortive disconnect
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_snddis(int " fd ", const struct t_call *" call );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint to disconnect.
.TP
.I call
a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure containing information about the disconnection.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_snddis ()
requests a disconnect of an existing transport connection, or refusal of an
outstanding connection indication.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint to disconnect or from which to refuse
the outstanding connection indication.  In the case of oustanding connection
indications, the local transport endpoint
.I fd
must be the same file descriptor upon which the outstanding connection
indication was received.  In addition,
.I fd
must have an outstanding connection indication count greater than one.
.PP
.I call
is a pointer to a
.B t_call
structure that specifies the responding address from which to disconnect, the
disconnect options, disconnect data, and the sequence number (or 0) of the
outstanding connection request which is being refused.
The
.B t_call
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_call {
        struct netbuf addr;     /* address              */
        struct netbuf opt;      /* options              */
        struct netbuf udata;    /* data                 */
        int sequence;           /* identification       */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_call
structure specifies the following members and information:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the responding address to use for refusing a connection
indication.
The
.I call->addr.len
is significant on call and ignored on return.
The
.I call->addr.maxlen
is meaningless.
If
.I call->addr.len
is zero on call, there is no responding address from which to send the data or
reject the outstanding connection indication.  In this case, the transport
address to which the local endpoint is bound will be used as the responding
address, if a responding address is required by the underlying protocol.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that contains the disconnect options.
The
.I call->opt.len
is significant on call and ignored on return.
The
.I call->opt.maxlen
is meaningless.
If
.I call->opt.len
is zero on call, there are not disconnect options associated with the request.
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that contains the disconnect data.
The
.I call->udata.len
is significant on call and ignored on return.
The
.I call->udata.maxlen
is meaningless.
If
.I call->udata.len
is zero on call, there is no data associated with the request.
.TP
.I sequence
specifies the sequence number, previously returned from a call to
.BR t_listen (3),
of the outstanding connection indication to which this disconnect request
(call refusal) pertains.  When
.BR t_snddis ()
is called nm
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_snddis ()
is only valid in states
.BR T_DATAXFER ", " T_OUTCON ", " T_OUTREL ", " T_INREL ", " T_INCON
with a non-zero number of outstanding indication requests, otherwise
.BR t_snddis ()
will fail and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ].
.PP
.BR t_snddis ()
is only valid for transport service providers for service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_snddis ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_snddis ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_snddis ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADSEQ ]
The
.I sequence
number provided was invalid, or is not associated with an outstanding connection indication.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.BR errno (3).
