.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SUN_SOURCE

.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsun.h>
.HP
int \fBmiocpullup\fR(mblk_t *\fImp\fR, size_t \fIlen\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
is a message pointer to a
.BR M_IOCTL (9),
.BR M_IOCDATA (9),
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
or
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message for an active
.BR ioctl (2)
operation.
.TP
.I len
is the number of bytes to pull up.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg
helper function that attempts to merge all of the leading data blocks of the same type following the
.I mp->b_cont
pointer of the passing in message block into a single data block still referenced by
.IR mp->b_cont .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
is used whenever it becomes necessary to concatenate the data contained in multipled data blocks
following a
.I STREAMS
input output control message.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR miocpullup ()
succeeds, it returns zero (0);
when it fails, it returns an non-zero error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR miocpullup ()
fails it returns a non-zero error number as follows:
.TP \w'EINVAL\ \ 'u
.B EINVAL
the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
the continuation pointer fo the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp->b_cont ,
is
.RB NULL ;
the passed in message block corresponds to a
.I TRANSPARENT
input output control sequence; or,
there are less than
.I size
bytes of data in the data portion of the message.
.TP
.B ENOSR
a
.I STREAMS
resource could not be allocated to complete the operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
can be called from any non-interrupt context, but is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
message block.  This is normally the case when
.BR miocpullup ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure and the passed in message pointer is that which
was passed into the procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
After several sanity checks,
.BR miocpullup ()
calls
.BR pullupmsg (9)
on the continuation pointer,
.IR b_cont ,
of the passed in message block,
.IR mp .
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR pullupmsg (9),
.BR mexchange (9),
.BR mexpandb (9),
.BR suncompat (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR miocpullup ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR miocpullup ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
For maximum portability, the message blocks and structures should be manipulated directly using
standard
.I STREAMS
utilities in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR miocpullup ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR miocpullup ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR miocpullup ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
