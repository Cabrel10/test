\- \fISTREAMS\fP break message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_BREAK
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_BREAK
message is a normal priority message that consists of one
.B M_BREAK
message block followed by an unspecified number of message blocks of unspecified type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_BREAK
message is sent to a driver to request that a
.I BREAK
be transmitted on whatever media the driver is controlling.  The message format is not defined by
.I STREAMS
and its use is developer dependent.  This message may be considered a special cast of an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message.  An
.\"
.B M_BREAK
messages cannot be generated by a user level process.
.B M_BREAK
messages arriving at the
Stream head
are discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_BREAK
messages may be generated by a driver or module.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B M_BREAK
message is only really useful for
.IR STREAMS -based
terminal IO drivers and modules, where its structure and use are better defined.
See
.BR ldterm (4).

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_BREAK
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.B M_BREAK
message has no portability issues.
.IP \(em
.B M_BREAK
has a different constant value on
older version of
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[

and older versions of
.IR LiS .

drivers and modules will use
