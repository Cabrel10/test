.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are command options.  When
.B --pipe
or
.B --connld
or
both are specified, a
.BR pipe (4)
stream is opened and attached to
.IR PATH .
When
.B --connld
is specified, the
.BR connld (4)
module is also pushed onto the pipe end that is then attached.
If neither
.B --pipe
or
.B --connld
is specified, the first non-option argument must be a path to a STREAMS
.I DEVICE
that will be opened and attached instead of a
.BR pipe (4).
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--pipe\fR
create a pipe to attach to
.IR PATH .
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--connld\fR
push
.BR connld (4)
on the first side of the pipe (implies
.BR -p ).
.PP
The following
.I options
can be used in conjunction with the command options listed above.
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--mode\fR
apply the mode of the old file after attaching to
.IR PATH .
.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fB--umask\fR
apply the umask after attaching to
.IR PATH .
.TP
\fB-M\fR, \fB--mode\fR
apply mode
.I MODE
after attaching the
.IR PATH .
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
suppress normal output (equivalent to
.BR --verbose = 0 ).
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fILEVEL\fR]
increment or set output verbosity to \fILEVEL\fR.  This option can be repeated.
.PP
The following options are general purpose command options.  When the option is encountered, the
information is displayed and
.B fattach
exists without processing further options or arguments.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B fattach
displays usage information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B fattach
displays version information on
.I stdout
and exits.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
.B fattach
displays copying and copyright information on
.I stdout
and exits.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I DEVICE
a
.I STREAMS
special character device to open and attach.
.TP
.I PATH
the filesystem path to which to attach the open stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B fattach
command provides a method for the caller to open a
.I STREAMS
device or
.BR pipe (4),
optionally pushing a
.BR connld (4)
module on the pipe, and attaching the resulting stream to a filesystem path using
.BR fattach (3).
The
.B fattach
command also provides the ability to adjust the permissions on the resulting file attached stream.
.PP
There are three forms of the
.B fattach
command.  The first is used to open a new
.BR pipe (4)
and attach one end to the specified
.IR PATH .
The second form also opens a new
.BR pipe (4)
and attaches one end to the specified
.IR PATH ;
however, it also pushes the
.BR connld (4)
module onto that end of the pipe before attaching it.
The third form is more general and opens the specified
.I DEVICE
and attaches that open stream to
.IR PATH .
.BR fattach (3)
is used to perform the attachment of the stream to
.IR PATH .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B fattach
is useful for use by startup scripts and other scripts that cannot directly use the
.BR fattach (3)
library call.  It can be used to establish named streams for servers.  The use of
.BR pipe (4)
and
.BR connld (4)
and their value in establishing local servers without the use of UNIX domain sockets
is described on those manual pages and in Stevens.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that the command was successful; one (1) indicates that an
error occured and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message is printed to
.IR stderr .

command requires the availability of the
.BR fattach (3)
library call.
