.TH CD_UNITDATA_ACK 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Communications Device Interface (CDI)"
.SH NAME
.B CD_UNITDATA_ACK
\- data send acknowledgement
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
.\"/*
.\" * CD_UNITDATA_ACK, M_PROTO type
.\" */
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_state;
} cd_unitdata_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This provider originated primitives acknowledges that the previous
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
primitive was acknowledged as sent.
.PP
.B CD_UNITDATA_ACK
primitives are indicated
or not depending on the output style as indicated in the
.I cd_output_style
field of the
.BR CD_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive as follows:
.TP
.B CD_UNACKEDOUTPUT
No
.B CD_UNITDATA_ACK
primitives will be indicated.
.TP
.B CD_ACKEDOUTPUT
.B CD_UNITDATA_ACK
primitives will be issued for every outstanding
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7).
.TP
.B CD_PACEDOUTPUT
.B CD_UNITDATA_ACK
primitives will only be issued as a timing clue for output.
.PP
When the
.BR CD_DISABLE_REQ (7)
primitive is requested, outstanding acknowledgments may be cancelled
depending on the value contained in the
.I cd_disposal
field of this primitive.
When the
.BR CD_ABORT_OUTPUT_REQ (7)
primitive is requested, outstanding acknowledgmens are cancelled.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Indicates the primitives type.
.TP
.I cd_state
The state of the CD provider following the acknowledgment.
.I cd_state
can be one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B CD_UNATTACHED
No PPA attached.
.TP
.B CD_UNUSABLE
PPA cannot be used.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLED
PPA attached.
.TP
.B CD_ENABLE_PENDING
Waiting ack of enable req.
.TP
.B CD_ENABLED
Awaiting use.
.TP
.B CD_READ_ACTIVE
Input section enabled; disabled after data arrives.
.TP
.B CD_INPUT_ALLOWED
Input section permanently enabled.
.TP
.B CD_DISABLE_PENDING
Waiting ack of disable req.
.TP
.B CD_OUTPUT_ACTIVE
Output section active only.
.TP
.B CD_XRAY
