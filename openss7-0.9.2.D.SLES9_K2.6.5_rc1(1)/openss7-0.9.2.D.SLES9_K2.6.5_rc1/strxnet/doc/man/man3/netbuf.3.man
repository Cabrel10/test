.TH NETBUF 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B netbuf
\- the XTI/TLI netbuf structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct netbuf {
        unsigned int maxlen;    /* max length           */
        unsigned int len;       /* current length       */
        char *buf;              /* data                 */
};

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B netbuf
structure is used in many XTI/TLI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
structures referenced in function calls for
passing opqaue arguments.
The
.B netbuf
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I maxlen
When the object of a
.B netbuf
structure is passed to an XTI/TLI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
library call as an input argument only, the
.I maxlen
field is meaningless and is ignored by the call.  Whenever the object of a
.B netbuf
structure is returned from an XTI/TLI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
library call as an output argument, the
.I maxlen
field specifies the length of the buffer pointed to by
.IR buf ,
into which the caller requests that the opaque object be returned.
.TP
.I len
When the object of a
.B netbuf
structure is passed to an XTI/TLI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
library call as an output argument only, the
.I len
field is meaningless to the call, but will be completed with the length of the
actual data returned in
.I buf
when
.I maxlen
on call was greater than zero.
Whenever the object of a
.B netbuf
structure is passed to an XTI/TLI
.[
XTI
.]
.[
XNS
.]
library call as an input argument, the
.I len
field specifies on call the length of the opaque object present at
.IR buf .
.TP
.I buf
A pointer to the buffer area which contains an input argument when
.I len
is greater than zero on call,
and which contains an output argument when
.I maxlen
is greater than zero on call and
.I len
is greater than zero on return.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
When
.I maxlen
is greater than zero and the size of the opaque data to be returned to the
caller is greater than
.IR maxlen ,
the call will fail with error
