.SH NAME
.B insq, lis_insq
\- inserts a message into a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int insq(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" emp ", mblk_t *" nmp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue into which to insert the message.
.TP
.I emp
the message on the queue before which to insert the message.
.TP
.I nmp
the message to insert.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR insq ()
inserts the message pointed to by
.I nmp
before the message pointed to by
.I emp
in the queue specified by
.IR q .
If the message pointer
.I emp
is
.B NULL
it indicates that the message pointed to by
.I nmp
is to be inserted at the end of the queue.
This means that
.BI insq( q ", NULL, " nmp )
is equivalent to
.BI putq( q ", " nmp ).
.PP
Messages can be inserted before other messages only if the
resulting insertion would not violate the proper ordering of priority and
banded messages within the queue.  This means that high priority messages can
be inserted before all messages.  Low priority messages can only be inserted
before low priority messages of the same or lesser priority band.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR insq ()
returns true (1) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
has been inserted into the queue.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR insq ()
returns false (0) and the message pointed to by
.I nmp
remains unaltered.  (See
.BR "\*(lqBUGS\*(rq" " below.)"
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR insq ()
fails, it returns false (0).
.BR insq ()
can fail because the passed in message pointer
.I nmp
is a
.B NULL
pointer;
the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is a
.B NULL
pointer;
the passed in queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a queue structure;
the queue associated with the passed in queue pointer
.I q
has flags
.BR QCLOSING " or " QPROCSOFF
set indicating that the queue is closing or has
had put and service routine
processing turned off (e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.PP
.BR insq ()
also fails if the message passed in by
.I nmp
cannot be inserted before the message passed in by
.IR emp .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR insq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR insq ()
is not MP-safe.
.BR insq ()
would be MP-safe, if the caller could ensure exclusive access to the passed in
messages and queue.
.PP
On uniprocessor systems it may be sufficient to block interrupts to ensure
exclusive access to
.IR q .
Ensuring exclusive access to the passed in message,
.IR emp ,
is difficult on SMP systems, because 
.BR putq "(9), " putbq (9) " and " insq (9)
can change
.I emp->b_next
and
.BR getq "(9), " flushq "(9), " flushband "(9) and " rmvq (9)
can change
.IR emp ,
(e.g. remove it from the queue).
.PP
Normally, exclusive access to the passed in queue on both UP and SMP systems can be ensured most
easily by freezing the stream associated with
.I q
using
.BR freezestr (9).
Otherwise, it is also possible to ensure exclusive access with
.BR MPSTR_STRLOCK (),
.BR MPSTR_QLOCK (),
.BR qwriter (),
.BR streams_put (),
or with appropriate synchronization boundaries
.RB ( STR_PERQUEUE " or " D_MTPERQ ).
However,
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
only has a broken
.BR freezestr (9),
subsequent to version 2.18.0,
and the other facilities metioned are not implemented in
.B LiS\c
.
.[
LiS
.]
This makes
.BR appq ()
unusable on MP systems in
.BR LiS .
.PP
This is similar to the synchronization necessary for use of
.BR insq (9)
and
.BR rmvq (9),
which are equally unusable on MP systems under
.BR LiS .

.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
For versions prior to OpenSS7 release
.BR LiS-2.16.18-17 ,
.B LiS
.[
lis
.]
incorrectly frees the message pointed to by
.I nmp
when the call to
.BR insq ()
fails due to a
.B NULL
queue pointer
.IR q ,
or when the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure,
or when the queue pointer
.I q
points to a queue that is closing or has processing turned off.
On the other hand,
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
does not free the message pointer pointed to by
.I nmp
when
.BR insq ()
fails because the insertion would mis-sequence the queue.
Because of this bug, when
.BR insq ()
returns failure (0), it is difficult to determine whether the message
pointed to by
.I nmp
has been freed or not.
This is inconsistent with SVR 4.2 MP and other implementations.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Beginning with OpenSS7 release version
.BR LiS-2.16.18-17
and for subsequent versions,
the message is not freed upon failure and the caller retains ownership of the
message subsequent to failure.
This is consistent with SVR 4.2 MP and other implementations.
.\"
.PP
However, for all releases,
.BR insq ()
still has bugs related to
.BR qprocsoff (9)
handling in that it fails while
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is in effect or if the stream is closing.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR insq ()
is source-level compatible with SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI,
.IR Solaris \(rg
and LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR insq ()
passed a
.B NULL
or invalid
.IR q " or " nmp
pointer will return failure (0).
.IP \(em
.BR insq ()
does not modify
.IR q " or " nmp
when it returns failure (0).  Under
.B LiS,
failure (0) modifies the
.I nmp
message, freeing it with
.BR freemsg (9)
under some circumstances.  This is an
.B LiS
bug on some versions of
.BR LiS .
No passed in structures should
be modified on failure.
.sp
On older versions,
.B LiS
incorrectly frees the message pointed to by
.I nmp
when the call to
.BR insq ()
fails due to a
.B NULL
queue pointer
.IR q ,
or when the queue pointer
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure, or when the queue pointer
.I q
points to a queue that is closing or has processing turned off.
On the other hand, LiS does not free the message pointer pointed to by
.I nmp
when
.BR insq ()
fails because the insertion would mis-sequence the queue.  Because of this
bug, when
.BR insq ()
returns failure (0), it is difficult to determine whether the message
pointed to by
.I nmp
has been freed or not.
.IP \(em
.BR insq ()
will insert messages into a queue that has had
.BR qprocsoff (9)
called or which is closing
.RB ( qclose (9)
has been called for the queue).  Under
.BR LiS ,
.BR insq ()
will return failure (0) in these cases and free the message pointed to by
.IR nmp .
.B LiS
behaviour is incorrect for these cases.
.BR qprocsoff (9)
only affects the running of queue procedures and should not affect
.BR insq ().
.BR qclose (9)
may need to exchange messages with lower level queue pairs and manipulate
queues: making
.BR insq ()
return
.B NULL
during close is an
.B LiS
bug.
.IP \(em
.BR insq ()
will insert a message before another in the queue in any order: it is the
caller's responsibility to ensure proper ordering of the queue.
Under
.BR LiS ,
.BR insq ()
will fail and return (0), not freeing
.IR nmp ,
if the insertion would misorder the queue.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
require that a stream be frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
for the duration of the call to
.BR insq ().
Under
.BR LiS ,
freezing a stream with
.BR LiS '
broken
.BR freezestr (9)
will have no effect on the operation of
.BR insq (9).
