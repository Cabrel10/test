The following is an extract from the manual to assist NexusWare developers:

6.3.3 Building from the Tar Ball
--------------------------------

If you have downloaded the tar ball (*note Downloading the Tar Ball::), then the
following instructions will rebuild the package on your system.  (Note that the
build process does not required `root' privilege.)

6.3.3.1 Native Build
....................

Folowing is an example of a native build against the running kernel:

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-0.9.2.D
     % ./configure
     % make
     % popd

6.3.3.2 Cross-Build
...................

Following is an example for a cross-build.  The kernel release version must
always be specified for a cross-build.(1)  If you are cross-building, specify
the root for the build with environment variable DESTDIR.  The cross-compile
host must also be specified if different from the build host.  Either the
compiler and other tools must be in the usual places where GNU `autoconf' can
find them, or they must be specified with declarations such as
`CC=/u5/NexusWare24/ppc-linux/gcc' on the `configure' command line.  Look in
the file `configure.nexusware' in the release package for an example.

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-0.9.2.D
     % ./configure DESTDIR="/some/other/root" \
     	--with-k-release=2.4.18 --host sparc-linux
     % make
     % popd

6.3.3.3 NexusWare Build
.......................

Additional support is provided for cross-building for the `Performance
Technologies Inc.' `NexusWare' embedded target for the CPC-384, CPC-388 and
CPC-396 cards.  A configuration script wrapper (`configure.nexusware') is
provided to simplify the cross-build operation for these targets.  The following
steps describe the process:

  1. Follow the normal `NexusWare' instructions for rebuilding a `generic'
     kernel and flash image as follows:  (Note that I keep my `NexusWare' build
     in `/u5/NexusWare24'.)

          % pushd /u5/NexusWare24
          % source SETUP.sh
          % make
          % popd

     For more recent `NexusWare' releases, the method for rebuilding a kernel
     is a little different as follows:

          % pushd /u5/NexusWare80
          % ./nexus 2.4
          % ./nexus 8260
          % ./nexus quick
          % . SETUP.sh
          % popd

  2. Next download, unpack (*note Downloading the Tar Ball::) and configure
     (*note Configuring the Tar Ball::) using the provided
     `configure.nexusware' wrapper for `configure'.  This wrapper simply tells
     the `configure' script where to find the `NexusWare' sources and which
     `NexusWare' cross-building tools to use for a cross-compile.(2)

     Any of the normal `configure' script options (*note Configuring the Tar
     Ball::) can be used on the same line as `./configure.nexusware'.  One of
     particular interest to embedded targets is `--with-k-optimize=size' to
     attempt to reduce the size of the kernel modules.

     You must specify the kernel version of the kernel for which you are
     configuring.  Add the -with-k-release=2.4.18 option for older `NexusWare'
     releases, -with-k-release=2.4.25 or -with-k-release=2.6.12 for more current
     `NexusWare' releases.

  3. Install as normal (*note Installing the Tar Ball::), however, for embedded
     targets the `install-strip' target should be used instead of the `install'
     target.  The `install-strip' target will strip unnecessary symbols from
     kernel modules and further reduce the size in the root file system flash
     image.


Following is what I use for configuration and installation: (My `NexusWare'
tree is rooted at `/u5/NexusWare'.)

     % pushd /u5/NexusWare80
     % ./nexus 2.4
     % ./nexus 8260
     % ./nexus quick
     % . SETUP.sh
     % popd
     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-0.9.2.D
     % ./configure.nexusware --with-k-release=2.4.25 --with-k-optimize=size
     % make
     % make DESTDIR="$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX" install-strip
     % popd

Once built and installed in the `NexusWare' directory, you will have to
(currently) hand edit a `.spec' file to include the components you want in the
`NexusWare' root file system.  If you are cross-building for `NexusWare' you
should already know what that means.  Objects that you might be interested in
copying to the root file system are kernel modules that were installed in
`$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/lib/modules/2.4.18/openss7', libraries installed in
`$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/usr/lib' and utility functions installed in
`$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/usr/bin' and `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/usr/sbin' and test programs
in `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/usr/libexec'.  If you would prefer that these programs be
installed in `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/lib', `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/bin',
`$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/sbin' and `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/libexec', (say because you want
to remote mount the `/usr' directory after boot), then specify the
`--exec-prefix=/' option to `./configure.nexusware'.

In addition, because `NexusWare' does not include an `/etc/modules.conf' file
by default, it will be necessary to add one or edit your `rc.4' file to
`insmod' the necessary `openss7' modules at boot time.

Also, `NexusWare' does not configure its kernels for CONFIG_KMOD, so any kernel
modules must be loaded by the `rc.4' init script at boot.  On more recent
`NexusWare' releases, the init scripts will be installed in
`$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/etc/rc.d/init.d/' but you must manually edit your `rc.4'
script to invoke these scripts.

Once you have completed the necessary `.spec' and `rc.4' file entries, you need
to rebuild the `generic' kernel flash image once more for these objects to be
included in the flash file system.  It is important that this second build of
the kernel image be the same as the first.

When modifying and rebuilding a `NexusWare' kernel, it will be necessary to
rebuild and install `openss7'.  Simply perform the last `make install-strip'
stage or start again with `./configure.nexusware'.  You can place the unpacked
tarball in `$NEXUSWARE_PREFIX/usr/src/openss7', and add the following to the
top-level `NexusWare' `Makefile' to make the build process a single step
process instead of dual pass:

     all:
     ...
             (cd kernels/generic; $(MAKE) depend)
             (cd usr/src/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1; $(MAKE) config)
             (cd kernels/generic; $(MAKE))
             (cd usr/src/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1; $(MAKE) pti)
             (cd usr/src/pti; $(MAKE))
             (cd drivers; $(MAKE))
             (cd utility; $(MAKE))
     #       uncomment for openss7 build
     #       (cd usr/src/openss7; ./configure.nexusware; $(MAKE) install-strip)
             (cd build/generic; $(MAKE))
     ...

Another, perhaps simpler approach, is to make the necessary edits to the
`NexusWare' top-level `Makefile' and `.spec' and `rc.4' files, download and
unpack the tar ball into the `NexusWare' directory, and build the `NexusWare'
flash image as normal:

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % pushd /u5/NexusWare24
     % source SETUP.sh
     % pushd usr/src
     % tar -xjvf ${DIRSTACK[2]}/openss7-0.9.2.D.tar.bz2
     % ln -sf openss7-0.9.2.D openss7
     % popd
     % make
     % popd

The situation is a little more complex for recent `NexusWare' releases.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Because it _is_ a cross-build, the kernel version on the build machine is
unlikely to be the kernel version of the target machine, except by coincidence.

(2) Although I have not tried it, because we use GNU `autoconf' for
configuration, these instructions should work equally well for the Solaris
`NexusWare' cross-building environment as it does for the Linux `NexusWare'
cross-building environment.
