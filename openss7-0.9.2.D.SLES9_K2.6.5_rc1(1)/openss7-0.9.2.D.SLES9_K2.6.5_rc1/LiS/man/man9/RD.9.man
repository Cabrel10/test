.SH NAME
.B RD
\- return the read queue of a \fISTREAMS\fR queue pair
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *RD(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the write queue of a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RD ()
returns the read queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the read queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.PP
.BR RD ()
is typically and often used to find the read queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR RD ()
returns a pointer to the read queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR RD ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR RD ()
is typically and often used to find the read queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR RD ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR RD ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q->q_other
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q->q_other
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RD ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
.BR RD ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
.BR RD ()
as a function rather than as the more obvious
macro:
.sp
.nf
#define RD(__q) __q->q_flags & QREADR ? __q : __q->q_other
.fi
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
function call is inefficient, particularly if this function is called often
and regularly.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RD ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RD ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.[
suxspg
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7spg
.]
.IR LiS ,
.[
lis
.]
permit both a read or write queue pointer to be passed
as the
.I q
argument to
.BR RD ().
If a read queue pointer is passed to
.BR RD (),
then the passed in read queue pointer is returned.
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
.[
uxpspg
.]
permit only a write queue to be passed as the
.I q
argument to
.BR RD ().
Passing a read queue to
.BR RD ()
on these implementations can cause a kernel panic.
On these systems
.BR RD ()
is often defined as:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#define RD(__q) ((__q)-1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.IP \(em
.BR RD ()
is implemented on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
as both an
.B extern inline
function as well as a macro.
It accepts either read or write queue pointer and returns the passed in read
queue pointer when called with a read queue.
.I RD(q) == RD(RD(q))
and
.I RD(WR(q)) == (WR(q) - 1)
are invariantly true.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#undef RD
#define RD(__q) ((__q)-1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.sp
is a valid alternative implementation if the
.I STREAMS
programmer wishes the more restrictive
.BR RD ()
behaviour.
.IP \(em
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not
call
.BR RD ()
with a queue other than the write queue;
nor
rely upon
.BR RD ()
being defined as a macro or a function.
.PP
For a fully functional and compatible
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
