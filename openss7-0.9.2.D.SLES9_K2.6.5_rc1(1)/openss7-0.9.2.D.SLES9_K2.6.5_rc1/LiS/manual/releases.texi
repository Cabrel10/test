When installing from the tarball (@pxref{Installing the Tar Ball}), this distribution is probably
compatible with a  much broader array of distributions than those listed above.  These are the
distributions against which the current maintainer creates and tests builds.

@node Linux Kernel
@subsection Kernel
@cindex Kernel

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package compiles as a @dfn{Linux} kernel module.  It is not
necessary to patch the @dfn{Linux} kernel to build or use the package.@footnote{At a later date, it
is possible to move this package into the kernel, however, with continued resistance to STREAMS from
within the @dfn{Linux} developer community, this is currently unlikely.} Nor do you have to
recompile your kernel to build or use the package.  OpenSS7 packages use @command{autoconf} scripts
to adapt the package source to your existing kernel.  The package builds and runs nicely against
production kernels from the distributions listed above.  Rather than relying on kernel versions, the
@command{autoconf} scripts interrogate the kernel for specific features and variants to better adapt
to distribution production kernels that have had patches applied over the official
@url{http://www.kernel.org/, kernel.org} sources.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10 and has
been tested up to and including 2.4.27.  It has been tested from 2.6.3 up to and including 2.6.17.
Please note that your mileage may vary if you use a kernel more recent than 2.6.17: it is difficult
to anticipate changes that kernel developers will make in the future.  Many kernels in the 2.6
series now vary widely ny release version and if you encounter problems, try a kernel within the
supported series.

UP validation testing for kernels is performed on all supported architectures.  SMP validation
testing is performed on UP machines, as well as on an Intel 3.0GHz Pentium IV 630 with
HyperThreading enabled.  Because HyperThreading is not as independent as multiple CPUs, SMP
validation testing is limited.

@node Linux Architectures
@subsection Architectures
@cindex Architectures

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package compiles and installs on a wide range of architectures.
Although it is believed that the package will work on all architectures supported by the Linux
kernel being used, validation testing has only been performed with the following architectures:

@itemize
@item ix86
@item x86_64
@item ppc (MPC 860)
@item ppc64
@end itemize

32-bit compatibility validation testing is performed on all 64-bit architectures supporting 32-bit
compatibility.  If you would like to validate an OpenSS7 package on a specific machine architecture,
you are welcome to sponsor the project with a test machine.

@end menu

@node Kernel Version 2.3.x
@subsubsection Kernel Version 2.3.x

For LiS version 2.7 and later and for kernel version 2.3.x there are some significant compatibility
issues.  Version 2.3 of the Linux kernel brings with it some compatibility issues that need to be
addressed by the LiS user.  The two most important ones concern the file @file{<sys/stropts.h>} and
the major device numbers used by LiS.  @pgindex stropts.h

@subsubheading @file{stropts.h} Compatibility
There are no more compatibility problems with @file{<sys/stropts.h>} with glibc-2.1 and LiS-2.10.
The following is more for historical purposes than practical necessity.

Beginning at least with egcs-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2 release), which comes with Red Hat 6.0, there is a
file in the standard include directory named @file{<sys/stropts.h>}.  This file has constant
definitions that are incompatible with those used in @file{LiS/include/sys/stropts.h}.  If you
compile an application against the glibc version of @file{stropts.h}, and compile LiS using its own
version then certain ioctls may not work correctly.  You should be aware of this problem and be sure
to include "-I/usr/src/LiS/include" in the compiler options that you use in compiling your STREAMS
based applications.

In this version of LiS, some of the constants in @file{stropts.h} have been changed to conform to
the values used by UnixWare and Solaris.  These are different values than previously used in LiS.
When you install LiS the installation procedure will ask you whether you want LiS compiled with the
backward-compatible LiS constants, or the UnixWare/Solaris compatible constants.  Logically
speaking, it does not matter which set you use as long as LiS and your application code are both
compiled with the same values.

I highly recommend that you use the UnixWare/Solaris compatible version, however.  A future release
of egcs, utilizing glibc 2.2, will contain an updated version of its @file{stropts.h} which has
constants that are compatible with UnixWare, Solaris and LiS.  So by selecting the UnixWare/Solaris
compatible version at this time you can ensure that your applications will be fully compatible with
these values in the future.

With any luck, these constants will never have to change again.

@subsubheading Major Device Number Compatibility
The second major compatibility issue concerns the major device numbers that LiS assigns to STREAMS
devices.  In the past LiS based these device numbers at 50, since the Linux kernel did not
pre-define many major device numbers.  As of kernel version 2.3.x there are major device numbers
defined up to 220 and beyone! So starting with LiS-2.12, we have used the major number of 240 as the
base for STREAMS device files.  This range is supposed to be reserved for "experimental drivers"
which should make it safe to use.

What this means is that you must be sure to run the strmakenodes program before running any STREAMS
applications after installing LiS-2.12.  This need not concern you overly, since doing a "make
install" in the @file{/usr/src/LiS} directory causes strmakenodes to be run anyway.  This is more a
concern if you are compiling LiS on one machine and then loading it onto another for execution.  In
such cases you may need to load the new strmakenodes program and run it.
@pgindex /usr/src/LiS

I am hoping that the kernel developers will expand the major and minor device number spaces for 2.6.
If they do that then LiS should be able to get a block of majors allocated to it.

@node Kernel Version 2.2.x
@subsubsection Kernel Version 2.2.x

For LiS version 2.5 and later and for kernel version 2.2.x there are no compatibility issues; there
are no kernel patches whatsoever required to install LiS.  You will need LiS-2.4 at minimum to run
in a 2.2.x kernel.

@node Kernel Version 2.0.36
@subsubsection Kernel Version 2.0.36

The latest version of LiS has not been tested on 2.0 kernels.  Therefore, do not be surprised if it
does not install or execute correctly in these kernels.  If you are using an old kernel, you must
also use an older version of LiS, perhaps LiS-2.5.

For LiS version 2.5 and later and for kernel version 2.0.36 there are no kernel patches required to
run LiS as a "bottom half" process.  A one-line patch is required to run LiS as a kernel daemon
process.  The installation default is to run as a bottom half process in 2.0.36.  LiS-1.25 or later
should install properly with 2.0.36.  The more recent the version of LiS, the less kernel patching
is required.

@node Linux STREAMS
@subsection Linux STREAMS
@cindex Linux STREAMS

@dfn{Linux Fast-STREAMS} provides a suitable replacement for the (now deprecated)
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} 2.18.0} package formerly maintained by Dave Goethe of

@node LiS-2.18 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.18 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

There are several issues that needed to be addressed for compatibility with the 2.6 Linux kernel.
You are encouraged to follow the links in the paragraphs below to see more detailed information on
each of these topics.

@enumerate
@item
The 2.6 kernel redefined the size of the dev_t structure.  LiS has extended its internal dev_t
structure to be compatible with the 2.6 method for some time.
@item
The 2.6 kernel changed the approach to building and installing kernel modules.  This affects LiS as
a whole and also affects how you install separate loadable STREAMS drivers.  LiS provides a
mechanism that allows STREAMS drivers and moduels to be easily installed.
@item
The 2.6 kernel offers an option to compile the kernel using machine registers to pass parameters to
functions.  LiS takes this into account.
@item
The 2.6 kernel needs GCC version 3.3.3 (sic) to be compiled properly.  LiS needs to be compiled
using the same version of the compiler when running with the 2.6 kernel.
@item
You may have to edit the file /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit to get demand loadable modules to work correctly.
This is especially true when hosting a 2.6 kernel on a 2.4 distribution.
@end enumerate

@node LiS-2.16 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.16 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

LiS-2.16 is a small change from LiS-2.15.  The change is that it no longer uses Linux system calls
to implement getpmsg and putpmsg.  Instead it overloads the read and write file system functions
with particular values for the count parameter, values that are otherwise invalid.@footnote{This
change is far from small because it outdates @file{libLiS.a} and @file{libLiS.so}.  A
@file{libLiS.a} or @file{libLiS.so} from a previous version will not work correctly.  All
applications statically linking @file{libLiS.a} must be recompiled to use a @file{libLiS.a} from the
more recent version.  Unfortunately, LiS did not include versioning on its libraries.  This has been
corrected with the OpenSS7 release of LiS.}

@node LiS-2.15 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.15 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

LiS-2.15 continues to insulate STREAMS drivers from the Linux kernel.  It works with 2.2, 2.4, and
2.5 versions of the kernel.  Support for 2.0 kernels has been dropped.

Driver writers will need to recompile their drivers against LiS-2.15 include files.  You will see
the following major changes.

@itemize @bullet
@item
LiS spin locks and semaphores have been rearranged so that the kernel memory is at the end of the
structure instead of the beginning.
@item
The former change allows for there to be dynamic allocation routines for spin locks and semaphores.
(@pxref{LiS Spin Locks})
@item
LiS now provides an abstraction for read/write locks, with dynamic allocation.  (@pxref{LiS
Read/Write Locks})
@item
Those experimenting with 2.5 kernels will notice that the "sleep while holding spin lock" problems
have been fixed.
@item
Porting to 2.5 has necessitated some changes to the major/minor device structure handling.
(@pxref{Major/Minor Device Numbering})
@item
The fattach related functions are functional on kernels version 2.4.7 and later.
@item
STREAMS pipes and FIFOs are now functional.
@item
OS interface code has been added for the kernel's DMA mapping functions.
@end itemize

There is one known bug in LiS-2.15 relative to 2.5 kernels.  It has to do with a memory leak
involving timer structures, and may prove to be a kernel bug rather than an LiS bug.  Since the 2.5
kernel is not suitable for general use I am saving the investigation of this bug for later.

@node LiS-2.14 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.14 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

LiS-2.13 was a series of beta releases.  LiS-2.14 represents the culmination of this series.  There
should be enough distribution and kernel compatibility that LiS-2.14 will hold up for some time.

The known fattach and FIFO bugs have still not been fixed.  The author of those subsystems has not
found the time to put in the fixes, nor have I.

@node LiS-2.13 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.13 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

This version of LiS has been tested with 2.4 kernels up to 2.4.16.  LiS does not yet support the
fattach/fdetach functions on kernel versions 2.4.7 and beyond.  There are also known bugs in the LiS
pipe/FIFO code.  All of these problems are scheduled to be fixed in early 2002.

LiS-2.13 adds the ability for drivers to make their own "/dev" nodes via the @dfn{lis_mknod}
function (@pxref{System Calls from within the Kernel}).  Also provided is an @dfn{lis_unlink}
function that allows drivers to remove their device files.

There is almost no new functionality added by LiS-2.13.  The differences between LiS-2.13 and
LiS-2.12 are almost entirely kernel compatibility issues and bug fixes.

@node LiS-2.12 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.12 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

This version of LiS is compatible with all 2.2.x versions of the kernel and with early versions of
the 2.4.x kernel, at least up to 2.4.2 and perhaps later versions as well.

If you have drivers that have worked with LiS-2.10 or LiS-2.11 (or earlier) please recompile them
using the header files from LiS-2.12.  This may be the last recompile in quite some time that you
will need for your driver code.

LiS-2.12 contains a sufficient Driver/Kernel Interface (DKI), (@pxref{Development}), that it is
straightforward to write a STREAMS driver that can be compiled against LiS-2.12 and the resulting
object modules used either on a 2.2 or 2.4 kernel, with only LiS needing recompilation on the target
machine.

When run on 2.4 kernels, LiS makes full use of multiple CPUs (@pxref{LiS SMP Implementation}).  It
forks a queue runner task for each CPU and locks each task onto its CPU.  Queue runner tasks are
awakened to assist with service procedure processing as the number of scheduled queues increases.

Because of this aggressive use of processors, you may find that your drivers do not function
properly when run with LiS-2.12 in a multi-CPU SMP environment.  You should expect that drivers that
worked in single-CPU environments will continue to work as before.

Making your drivers MP safe involves the use of spin locks.  The DKI documentation contains advice
on the use of these locks.  @xref{LiS Spin Locks}.

This version of LiS also contains a rewrite of the flushing code and tests added to strtst for
flushing.  In particular the details of the rules for flushing queue bands are now adhered to.
@xref{Flushing Queue Bands}.  Be advised, however, that Solaris STREAMS does not adhere strictly to
these rules so there may be some subtle differences in behavior between LiS and Solaris when
flushing queue bands.

Speaking of queue bands, the queue band handling code has been debugged a bit more and a test added
to strtst to illustrate its correct behavior.

@node LiS-2.10 Kernel and Driver Compatibility
@subsubsection LiS-2.10 Kernel and Driver Compatibility

This version of LiS is compatible with all 2.2.x versions of the Linux kernel.  It may work with
2.4.x kernels, but you should probably wait for LiS-2.11 for that.

If you have drivers that worked with LiS-2.8 or earlier, you must recompile your drivers in the
context of the LiS-2.10 header files.  The queue_t structure has changed in size since LiS-2.8 which
means that the old RD and WR macros will not compute the correct addresses.

LiS-2.10 contains features that are intended to greately reduce the necessity of recompiling STREAMS
driver code in future versions of LiS or future versions of the kernel.  The goal is to be able to
compile STREAMS drivers against LiS-2.10 header files and use the resulting object code on both
2.2.x kernels and 2.4.x kernels.

For more details about the interface between STREAMS drivers and the kernel, see the Driver/Kernel
Interface documentation, (@pxref{Development}).

@cindex release LiS-2.18.2

Cross-build support for newer @cite{Nex@-us@-Ware} releases.  Build support for (recent FC4) 2.6.14
kernel.  Corrected installation support (init scripts) for SuSE 9.2.

Binary compatibility backwards compatible to GCOM 2.18.0 included.  This includes exported symbols
changed to not generate versioned symbols on 2.4 kernels.  Also, exported symbols are always
compiled @code{attribute((regparm(0)))} on regparm capable architectures, regardless of the kernel
version or compile options.@footnote{Regparm capable architectures are really just @code{__i386__}
and similar such as @code{__x86_64__} and @code{k8}.}
For actual binary compatibilty packaging, see the @file{strcompat} package.

A major change for 2.18.2 is the port-back of POSIX/SUSv3 XSR/XSI conformance test suites and
performance programs from Linux Fast-STREAMS.  The purpose of porting back theses tests suites and
supporting modules and drivers is to provide the ability to do comparison tests between LiS and
Linux Fast-STREAMS.

Another change is a module unloading safe vstrlog hook register and unregister functions
register_strlog() and unregister_strlog().

Some bug corrections and fixes for glaring SMP errors reported by Kutluck.

This might be the last OpenSS7 release of @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.  You should seriously
consider using the Linux Fast-STREAMS package (streams-0.7a.4 or later) instead.  If you need
comptibility to LiS (or other STREAMS implementation), investigate the strcompat package, which
provides some binary compatibility to LiS under Linux Fast STREAMS.

@node Release LiS-2.18.1
@subsection Release LiS-2.18.1
@cindex release LiS-2.18.1

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the @command{@value{PACKAGE}} release.

This is a port forward of most of the build and patches from 2.16.19 forward and applied over
2.18.0.  This is our first LiS-2.18 release.  All further development on 2.16.19 will now cease.
2.18.1 is maintained on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  No active development will be performed on
2.18.1, only maintenance.  For an active development release, see the Linux Fast-STREAMS releases.

Major changes from LiS-2.18.0 include all of the autoconf build system, manual pages and texi/pdf
manual for LiS that were applied on the 2.16.19 release.  This includes a number of 64 bit, HPPA,
PARISC, printf, atomic stats, HZ calculations for 64bit machines, DMA patch for mblk buffer
alignment, flush handling patch, panic patch, smp patch, parisc syscall patch, appq patch, and
multithreaded test program patches, POSIX threads compilant library functions.

Additional changes made to support later 2.6 kernels and distributions.  Switched
putpmsg()/getpmsg() to use ioctl for system call emulation instead of read()/write(), primarily
because 2.6.11 kernels check for a valid count before calling the driver's read()/write() file
operations.  Updates to the build system to support a wider range of kernels and distributions.  See
the installation and reference manual for a complete list of supported kernels and distributions.

Please note that the entire package is released under GPL.

@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-22
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-22

Replaced m4 and automake files with common equivalents.  This allows the same set of m4 macros and
automake fragments to be used with all of the OpenSS7 release packages.  Maintenance is easier as
one correction will propagate across all items.  Performed similar function with texinfo
documentation pieces.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-21
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-21
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-21

Removed all XTI/TLI and Linux networking code, headers and documentation from LiS distribution and
bumped epoch to 2.  Linux networking code has been migrated to the @strong{strxns},
@strong{strxnet}, @strong{strinet} and @strong{strsctp} packages.  The purpose for doing this was to
allow the Linux networking to build against Linux Fast-STREAMS as well as
@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} and is a preparation for phasing out LiS and phasing in LfS.

Added missing @file{configure.nexusware} to distribution.  LiS cache options now default to 'no'
because of instabilities with timers.

Not publicly released.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-19
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-19
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-19

Changes to compile, install and builds rpms for Fedora Core 1 (FC1), Whitebox Enterprise Linux
(WBEL) and RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 (EL3).  Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in
spec file for RPM versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection and moved
getpmsg and putpmsg manual pages.

Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during non-rpm autoconf installation.

Correction to zero @code{maxlen} behavior in @code{t_rcvconnect()}.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-18
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-18
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-18

Added check for @code{CONFIG_REGPARM}, addition of @code{-mregparm=3} @code{CFLAGS}, addition of
@code{regparm_} prefix for exported ksyms.

Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and caching of detected ksyms.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-17
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-17
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-17

Added option @code{--disable-k-modversions} to supress versioning of LiS exported symbols.

A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.  Changed order of build in `make
rebuild' target to build tools last so that the rpm debug package is built correctly on RH9.

Change @code{MODULE_PARM} to static so that @code{make install-strip} does not strip module
parameter symbols.

Added @code{lis_check_mem_region()}, @code{lis_release_mem_region()} and
@code{lis_request_mem_region()} for memory mapped io instead of just io.

Added @code{printk} patches discussed on linux-stream mailling list.  Added gcc @code{printf}
checking and corrected errors in LiS debugging @code{printk} statements.

Added HP patches.  There are a couple of questionable components in the HP patches that I reversed.
They include;

@itemize @bullet
@item
modification of @code{lis_msgsize} to @code{lis_msgdsize}.  This would change the calculation of
queue counts.  Queue counts aren't @code{M_DATA} counts, they are "data" message counts.  LiS
probably doesn't have this the right way, but @code{lis_msgdsize} is not correct either.

@item
addition of @code{qi_mstat->ms_pcnt} increment on @code{lis_safe_putmsg}.  Same for @code{ms_scnt},
@code{ms_ocnt}, @code{ms_ccnt}.  STREAMS is not supposed to increment counts.  It is the module
writer's responsibility to increment counts in their own queue procedures.
@end itemize


Added HP @code{ldl} patches.

Made modifications to @code{putq()}, @code{putbq()}, @code{insq()} and @code{appq()} discussed on
linux-streams mailing list.  These do not free messages on failure.  Modified all ocurrences
internal to LiS to free the message on error to ensure old behavior.

Added HP dejagnu patches to @code{strtst} and added dejagnu testsuite directory and file.  Added the
@code{make check} target.  Use @code{DEJATOOLS} on the make command line to invoke the tests, such
as `@code{make DEJATOOLS=strtst check}' to invoke the tests.  Because a patched @code{netperf} is
not commonly available and @code{netperf} will not be distributed with the package, GNU
@code{autotest} might be a better choice.  But that's for a later release.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-16
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-16
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-16

General updates to the build process, optimization options, build options.  Corrected library
linkage.  Synced TLI modules and INET driver to Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Removed deadlock from INET
driver and loosened locking.  Unfortunately suitable libraries must be installed before distcheck
will clear.

Smoother and more reliable stripping of kernel symbols, starts with /proc/ksyms if applicable then
System.map then modversions.h to attempt to choose symbols most closely synced with an installed or
running kernel.

Improvements to autoconf installation of manpages (autocompressed now) and info and pdf manuals are
distributed.  install-strip target will actually properly strip kernel modules.

Included an option to build and install only kernel or user parts of package to speed rpm rebuild
process for multiple kernel.  Added `rebuild' target to rebuild the rpms from srpm for multiple
kernel and architectures.  Added a `sign' and `resign' target to sign srpm and rebuilt rpms
respectively.

Greatly enhanced cross-build and cross-compile support, primarily in support of the NexusWare
embedded target.  Added NexusWare helper script and documentation.  DESTDIR is now a blessed
environment variable used by configure to set the cross-build root as well as the install root.  Try
adding --with-k-optimize='size' to configure to optimize for size for embedded targets.  Builds
clean against NexusWare24 (810p0674.10-rc4).

Added start of an option to build as linkable object for embedded targets rather than loadable
kernel module.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-12
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-12
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-12

Added defaults for SK_WMEM_MAX and SK_RMEM_MAX for lastest 2.4.25 and 2.4.26 kernel builds.

Enhanced build process.
  
All kernel symbols exported by LiS are versioned on kernels that have versioned symbols.  This makes
it safer to compile kernel modules against kernel/LiS combinations.  This is in preparation for
splitting off the strxnet package, and the technique was imported from the Linux Fast-STREAMS build.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-11
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-11
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-11

Ripped three additional kernel symbols in support of INET driver that were missing in -10 release.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-10
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-10
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-10

Added support for cooked manpages both for non-rpm systems and for rpm systems.  It is still better
to leave manpages uncooked for rpm releases because they are much smaller that way.  Give the
--with-cooked-manpages flag to configure if you want cooked manpages.  You still need grefer on the
build system.

Updates to all manual pages in man7, and some others (xti) in man3.  Removed unused .macros and
.refs files.

Moved automake fragments into separate directory.  Cleaned up automake fragments.

Rearranged header files in the xti subdirectory to install in LiS package include directory instead.
Reworked xti, tihdr and tiuser file groups to include properly from kernel or user space independent
of order.  tiuser and xti still cannot be included together.  Added older TLI interface <tiuser.h>
that is still consistent with newer XTI interface.  Changed references in man pages to XTI/TLI
instead of just XTI.

Added ticlts.h, ticots.h and ticotsord.h header files.  Updated dlpi.h and npi.h header files.
Removed sys/LiS/tpicommon.h because it is largely replaced by sys/tli.h and sys/tpi.h.  Removed the,
now redundant, xti header file subdirectory.

A series of bug fixes to xnet.c (libxnet) that resulted from discussions with Gurol Akman on
openss7-develop mailing list.  Mostly surrounding t_alloc and t_getinfo behaviour and the behavior
when NULL pointers are passed to various XTI/TLI library calls.  Updated xti documentation as well.

Many changes to the inet.c INET driver.  Wildcard IP addresses can now be bound and wildcard
addresses will be assigned with no address is passed to most providers.  (/dev/rawip still requires
an address or TNOADDR is returned.)  Option management has been extensively rewritten to be more
conformant to XNS documentation.  Test programs test-inet_raw, test-inet_udp, test-inet_tcp have
been upgraded and converted to multiple child processes.  A number of fixes to SMP lock behavior and
M_FLUSH have beend added as reported by Dave Grothe.  Corrected all level and TBADOPT behavior on
negotiation.

Although this driver is now closer to expected behavior, it has not been tested for XNS 5.2
compliance, nor will it be until someone has the time to extend the test programs to handle all test
cases in a similar manner as was done for the library.  Your mileage many vary.  Remember, there is
no warranty.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-9
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.18-9
@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-9

Changes primarily in support of builds on HPPA (PARISC) architectures.  LiS doesn't build too well
on PARISC so some modifications where used from the Linux Fast-STREAMS package to correct
deficiencies.  Better building on recent 2.4 kernels (2.4.23, 2.4.24, 2.4.25) is also provided.

@node Release LiS-2.16.18-8

@cindex release LiS-2.16.18-1

This OpenSS7 release of LiS-2.16.18 updates the previous LiS-2.16.16 rpm release to the lastest
LiS-2.16 release level.

@node Release LiS-2.16.16-1
@subsection Release LiS-2.16.16-1
@cindex release LiS-2.16.16-1

This OpenSS7 release of LiS-2.16.16 includes autoconf for configuration, complete manual pages and
documentation, and packaging in source and binary RPMs for ease and repeatability of installation.
The package also builds and installs properly versioned LiS shared object libraries.

Before the OpenSS7 release of LiS, it was necessary to have a significant working knowledge of the
Linux kernel, kernel source, headers and other intricacies.  This made it difficult to distribute
software based on LiS to users not proficient in those areas.  The OpenSS7 release removes the
configuration and installation tasks from the user and permits distribution of applications, modules
and driver software based on LiS to users without sufficient kernel expertise to install the
package.

This OpenSS7 release fixes few of the outstanding bugs and deficiencies of the LiS software.  This
release is intended to package and distribute LiS in an efficient manner and, for the most part,
does not address LiS deficiencies or errors.

This OpenSS7 release is compatible with Linux 2.4 kernels only and will refuse to configure for
older or newer kernels.

Following are the new features of the OpenSS7 release of LiS:

@itemize @bullet
@item
adds configuration using the GNU tools, autoconf, automake and autotest.

These tools greatly enhance the ability to maintain a repeatable and testable release cycle as well
as being compatible with most major package managers such as Redhat's RPM.

@item
adds long options to all LiS utilities.

This change was necessitated because we use GNITS (the strictest level) of configuration with
autoconf that requires for distribution checking that all utility programs support the @samp{--help}
and @samp{--version} long options wtihout side-effects.

@item
provides a source and binary release mechanism using both autoconf distributions as well as RedHat
source and binary RPMs.

Use of the RPM mechanism for release permits add-on packages to ensure that they have sufficient
level of support and verionsing of the LiS load during their build and installation process.  It is
now also possible to ensure that add on binaries are compatible with a loaded LiS during
installation.

@item
includes a complete set of kernel programmer manual pages for all LiS exported kernel functions for
use by STREAMS module and driver developers.

@item
includes a complete set of user manual pages for all libLiS functions and separate administrative
utilities.

@item
includes the OpenSS7 strinet driver providing XTI/TLI access to the Linux native NET4 IP stack
including TCP, UDP, IP and (and OpenSS7 SCTP if your kernel is so equipped).

@item
includes functional @code{tirdwr} and @code{timod} modules for use with the included XTI/TLI
library.@footnote{The @code{tirdwr} module included with the Gcom LiS-2.16.18 (and even more
current) releases is almost completely disfunctional and has been replaced in entirety.}

@item
includes complete, thread-safe XNS 5.2 XTI/TLI library support with the @file{libxnet} library,
complete manual pages and documentation released under the LGPL (@pxref{GNU Lesser General Public
License}).

The next release may include some @dfn{strss7} software.

@node Pre-Alpha Releases
@subsection Pre-Alpha Releases

@dfn{Pre-alpha} releases are releases that have received no testing whatsoever.  Code in the release
is not even known to configure or compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documenation available for insepection only, and to solicit comments on the design approach or other
characteristics of the software package.

@dfn{Pre-alpha} release packages ship containing warnings recommending that the user not even
execute the contained code.

@node Alpha Releases
@subsection Alpha Releases

@dfn{Alpha} release are releases that have received little to no testing, or that have been tested
and contains known bugs or defects that make the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose
for an @dfn{alpha} release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional purpose
that it is an earily release of partially functional code that has problems that an external
developer might be willing to fix themselves and contribute back to the project.

@dfn{Alpha} release packages ship containing warnings that executing the code can crash machines and
might possibly do damage to systems upon which it is executed.

@node Beta Releases
@subsection Beta Releases

@dfn{Beta} releases are releases that have received some testing, but the testing to date is not
exhaustive.  @dfn{Beta} release packages do not ship with known defects.  All known defects are
respolved before distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown
defects may exist.  The purpose for a @dfn{beta} release is to provide a baseline for other
organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the package.

@dfn{Beta} release packages ship containing warnings that the package has not been exhaustively
tested and that the package may cause systems to crash.  Suitability of software in this category
for production use is not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of the
user of the software.

@node Gamma Releases
@subsection Gamma Releases

@dfn{Gamma} release are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project, but
external testing has been minimal.  @dfn{Gamma} release packages do not ship with known defects.  As
exhaustive internal testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please remember that
there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Gamma} release packages typically resolve problems in previous @dfn{beta} releases, and might
not have had full regression testing performed.  Suitability of software in this category for
production use is at the discretion of the user of the software.   @dfn{The OpenSS7 Project}
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the package be performed and pass
on target systems before considering production use.

@node Production Releases
@subsection Production Releases

@dfn{Production} releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing within the project and
validated on specific distributions and architectures.  @dfn{Production} release packages do not
ship with known defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

@dfn{Production} packages ship containig a list of validated distributions and architecutres.
Full regression testing of any maintenance changes is performed.  Suitability of software in this
category for production use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform validation tests on the set of
supported target systems before considering production use.

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the @cite{OpenSS7 Project}, the
@cite{OpenSS7 Project} software does not ship with known bugs in any release stage except
@dfn{pre-alpha}.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} had many known bugs at the time of release.

@dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} has many known bugs.  Under some architectures, the test cases in the
conformance test suite cause the kernel to lock or crash.  @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} contains many
races and defects and is unsuitable for production environments.  This section provides a summary of
some (but not all) known defects.

@enumerate
@item
A substantial group of test cases in the @dfn{POSIX} conformance test suite fail.  This is largely
due to non-fatal defects in LiS.
@item
A number of test cases fail under any architecture and result in a kernel lock.  In particular if a
significant number of modules are pushed onto a Stream using I_PUSH, the kernel will lock when the
Stream is closed.  The number of modules pushed to cause a crash depends on the speed of the machine
upon which the test case is run.  The test case in the test suite pushes 64 modules and has always
resulted in a kernel lock regardless of the machine speed upon which it was tested.  Pushing 20
modules results in a kernel lock on some of the @cite{OpenSS7 Project} 2.57GHz test machines.

As a result, any test case that pushes a number of modules, and the performance tests (that push
modules for measurement) will cause the kernel to lock.
@item
A large number of test cases fail when running under an SMP kernel, regardless of the number of
processors on the test system.  These test cases cause the kernel to lock.  The kernel locks are
apparentlhy due to locking defects in the implementation.  None of these implementation defects have
been repaired.
@item
The original @file{LiS-2.18.0} release from @cite{GCOM} has a large number of defects that were
repaired in the @cite{OpenSS7} @file{LiS-2.18.1} release.
@item
The original @cite{LiS-2.18.0} release has defects in the description of data types and handling
under 64-bit architectures.  32-bit compatibility for 64-bit architectures is all but non-existent
in the LiS-2.18.0 release.  Because of binary compatibility issues, many of these defects persist in
the @cite{OpenSS7} @file{LiS-2.18.1} and @file{LiS-2.18.2} releases.  LiS is largely unusable in a
64-bit and almost completely unusable in a mixed architecture.
@end enumerate

The work-around for these defects is to not use LiS at all: use the @cite{OpenSS7 Linux
Fast-STREAMS} release instead.  The @cite{OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS}, being a completely
independent implemenation, does not suffer from this extensive set of LiS defects.
