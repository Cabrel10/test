.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I head
a pointer to the statically allocated
.B caddr_t
pointer that was used to add instances to the list with convenience functions such as
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is a
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
convenience function that assists without housekeeping during
.I STREAMS
module or driver open, link, close or unlink operations.
The
.IR MPS \(rg
convenience functions, including
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
and
.BR mi_close_comm (9),
maintain a list of
.I STREAMS
module or driver instances in a list global to the module or driver.
Both pushable module instances as well as device driver instances can be maintained in the same list.
.PP
Pushable module instances are those instances that were added to the list with
.I sflag
equal to
.B MODOPEN
on a call to
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
Device driver instances are those instances that we added to the list with
.I sflag
equal to
.BR CLONEOPEN " or " DRVOPEN
on a call to
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
.PP
When both pushable module instances and device driver instances are maintained by the
.I STREAMS
driver in the same list,
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
can be used to find the first device driver instance in the list.
.BR mi_next_dev_ptr (9)
can then be used to iterate through the device driver instances in the list.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is used when the caller wishes to iterate through only the device driver instances on a
.I STREAMS
module or driver global instance list.
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is passed the same statically allocated
.I head
pointer that was passed to functions such as
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
that added instances to the list.
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
returns
.B NULL
if there is no device driver instance on the list, or returns a pointer to the private structure of
the first device instance on the list.
It is then possible to iterate throught the device instances on the list by passing the pointer
returned by
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
to
.BR mi_next_dev_ptr (9)
to obtain the next device driver instance on the list, or
.B NULL
if there is no subsequent device driver instance, and so on.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the private instance data
.RI ( q->q_ptr )
associated with first device driver instance on the global list;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is always successful.  However, when passed an invalid pointer or a pointer to an invalid structure,
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
might destabilize the kernel or cause an immediate or delayed kernel panic.

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
can be called from any context, but is normally called from within a
.I STREAMS
driver open, close, put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is not MP-safe; no protection is afforded to the list entry.  An iterator taken in this fashion can
be invalidated without the caller's knowledge.  It is the responsibility of the caller to protect
the validity of the instance while it is in use.  While there are some utilities in
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
that can provide assistance; there is little mention of their use in the
.IR MPS \(rg
documentation.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is a
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MPS_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
implementation of these functions maintain the module instances and the driver instances in the same
global list; however, list elements are sorted with respect to their device driver numbers.  Modules
are added to the list with a zero
.RB ( 0 )
major device number and the next available minor device number.  This places module instances ahead
of device driver instances in the list.
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
simply iterates down the list looking for the first instance with a non-zero major device number and
that is the first device driver instance in the list.
.PP
The
.IR MPS \(rg
open and close convenience functions can also be used when a stream is linked under (open) or
unlinked from (close) a multiplexing driver.  These instances should use the linkid as the device
number and should be maintained in a global (ilink) list separate from the primary (open) list.
Because multiplexing driver links lists use an arbitrary linkid,
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
will not work on those lists.

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Very little documentation exists on the proper use of
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
and
.BR mi_next_dev_ptr (9).
If the user really wishes to keep module instances and driver instances, they should be kept in
separate global open lists and the better documented
.BR mi_first_ptr (9)
and
.BR mi_next_ptr (9)
used instead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Standard
.I STREAMS
and system utility functions should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_first_dev_ptr ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
