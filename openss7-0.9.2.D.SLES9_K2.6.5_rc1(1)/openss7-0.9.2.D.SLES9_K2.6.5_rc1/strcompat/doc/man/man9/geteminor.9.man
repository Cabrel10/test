.HP

.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I dev
the device number to convert to an external (real) minor.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getemajor (9),
.BR geteminor (9)
and
.BR makedev (9)
functions are intended to supplement the
.BR getmajor (9),
.BR getminor (9)
and
.BR makedevice (9)
functions.
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
gets the external (real) device minor number associated with the external
.B dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR geteminor ()
is a UWDDI specific architecture dependent macro intended to replace the
older
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
behaviour of
.BR getminor (9).
.BR geteminor ()
is a system dependent way for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module to obtain the external (real) minor device number from the
external device number.
.BR geteminor ()
is often implemented as an architecture dependent macro, whereas
.BR getmajor ()
is an architecture independent function call.
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
is an architecture dependent function that obtains the external (real) minor
device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.BR getminor (),
on the other hand,
will return the
.I extended
minor device number associated with the device
.IR dev .
.PP
.BR getminor (9)
supports the concept of
.I extended
minor device numbers.  Under
.I extended
minor device numbering, a device as a single
.I base
major device number and an extended range of minor device numbers (exceeding
255).  Real device numbers consist of a number of major device numbers and a
range of minor device numbers associated with each major device number from 0
to 255.
.PP
Following is an example contrasting the mapping of external major and minor
device numbers to a based major device number and an extended minor device
number:

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR getemajor ()
is used by drivers and modules that required knowledge of the external (real)
minor device number and for use internal to the
.I STREAMS
executive.
.PP
Normally, a
.I STREAMS
module or driver
.BR qopen (9)
procedure will use the
.BR getminor (9)
function to obtain the 
.I extended
minor device number and deal with the assignment of
.I extended
minor device numbers using the
.BR makedevice (9)
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
returns the external (real) minor device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg-specific
macro:
.BR _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[

must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
uses
.BR MINOR (9)
to obtain the external minor device number.

has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR geteminor ()
is compatible with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR geteminor ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.
Under
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.BR geteminor ()
is normally implemented as an architecture dependent macro.
.IP \(em
.BR geteminor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR UnixWare \(rg
or
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because the
.B dev_t
structure for
.B Linux
differs from that of
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR geteminor ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR geteminor ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.IP \(em
LiS
.[
LiS

does not provide this function.
