.SH NAME
.B DL_DATA_ACK_REQ (dl_data_ack_req_t)
\- this request is passed to the Data Link Provider to request that a DLSDU
be sent to a peer DLS User using acknowledged connectionless mode data unit
transmission procedures.
.SH SYNOPSIS
Consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block containing the structure shown below, followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
blocks containing one or more bytes of data.  The amount of user data that may
be transferred in a single DLSDU is limited.  This limit is conveyed by the
parameter
.I dl_max_sdu
in the
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This request is passed to the Data Link Provider to request that a DLSDU be
sent to a peer DLS User using acknowledged connectionless mode data unit
transmission procedures.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_DATA_ACK_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_correlation
conveys a unique identifier which will be returned in the
.BR DL_DATA_ACK_STATUS_IND (7)
primitive to allow the DLS User to correlate the status to the appropriate
.B DL_DATA_ACK_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address of the destination DLS User.  If the
destination user is implemented using DLPI, this address is the full DLSAP
address returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the destination DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address of the source DLS User.
.TP
.I dl_src_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the source DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_priority
indicates the priority value within the supported range for this
particular DLSDU.
.TP
.I dl_service_class
specifies whether or not an acknowledge capability in the medium access
control sublayer is to be used for the data unit transmission.
.RS
.TP
.B DL_RQST_RSP
request acknowledgement service from the medium access control sublayer if
supported
.TP
.B DL_RQST_NORSP
no acknowledgement service requested from the medium access control
sublayer.
.RE
.SH STATE
This message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH RESPONSE
If the request is erroneous, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned, and the resulting state is unchanged.  If the DLS Provider accepts
the data for transmission, a
.BR DL_DATA_ACK_STATUS_IND (7)
is returned.  This indication will indicate the success or failure of the data
transmission.  Although the exchange service is connectionless, in-sequence
delivery is guaranteed for data sent by the initiating station.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The destination DLSAP address was in an incorrect format or contained
invalid information.
.TP
.B DL_BADDATA
The amount of data in the current DLSDU exceeded the DLS provider's
DLSDU limit.
.TP
.B DL_NOTSUPPORTED
Primitive is valid, but not supported.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_UNSUPPORTED
Requested service or priority not supported by Provider (Request with
response at the Medium Access Control sublayer).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Data Link Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
