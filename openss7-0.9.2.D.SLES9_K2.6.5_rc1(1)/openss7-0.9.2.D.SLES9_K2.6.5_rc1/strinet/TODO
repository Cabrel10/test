Things to do:

- Convert inet driver to use os7 common functions.

- Pure STREAMS RAW and UDP implementation.  A higher performance RAW and
  UDP implementation supporting both TPI and NPI would be nice to have.
  The OpenSS7 Project needs an NPI RAW implementation that can tap UDP
  primarily for use with RTP.  Also, it will be interesting to test the
  performance differences between STREAMS UDP and Sockets UDP.

  *done*

    udp2 and rawip2 drivers implemented and tested.  strxns package now
    has an np_ip driver for raw access to IP (primarily for SCTP
    conformance testing).  RTP drivers should be based on udp2 driver.


- Connectionless testing using netperf competes well with
  connection-oriented sockets.  Need to still modify netperf to use
  (pseudo-)connection-oriented UDP for better comparison.


- 32bit compatibiltiy testing.

  *done*

    Ran ix86 test suite binaries on x86_64.


- SMP Testing.

  *done*
  
    What I did was to perform SMP testing for Intel Pentium IV 630 HT at
    least.
