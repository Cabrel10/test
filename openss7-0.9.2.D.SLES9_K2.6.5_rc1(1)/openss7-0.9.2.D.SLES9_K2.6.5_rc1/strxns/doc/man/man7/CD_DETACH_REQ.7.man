.SH NAME
.B CD_DETACH_REQ
\- detach from a physical point of attachment
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PROTO
or
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
} cd_detach_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user originated primitive requests that the requesting stream be detached
from the Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) to which it was previously
attached with a successful
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7)
primitive.
.SS Parameters
This primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I cd_primitive
Specifies the primitives type.
.SS State
This primitive is only valid in state
.BR CD_DISABLED .
The new state is
.BR CD_UNATTACHED .
.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the provider to acknowledge the receipt of the
.B CD_DETACH_REQ
primitive as follows:
.PP
.B "Successful:"
When the primitive is successful, the provider acknowledges receipt of the
primitive with the
.BR CD_OK_ACK (7)
primitives.
.PP
.B "Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):"
When unsuccessful, the provider acknowledges receipt of the primitive with the
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive indicating the error.
