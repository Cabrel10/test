.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DL_CONNECT_IND
conveys to the local DLS user that a remote (calling) DLS user wishes to
establish a data link connection.  The indication contains the DLSAP address
of the calling and called DLS user, and the quality of service parameters as
specified by the calling DLS user and negotiated by the DLS provider.
.PP
The
.B DL_CONNECT_IND
also contains a number that allows the DLS user to correlate a subsequent
.BR DL_CONNECT_RES "(7), " DL_DISCONNECT_REQ "(7), or " DL_DISCONNECT_IND (7)
with the indication (see Multi-threaded Connection Establishment
.BR dlpi (7)).
.PP
The number of outstanding
.B DL_CONNECT_IND
primitives issued by the DLS
provider must not exceed the value of
.I dl_max_conind
as returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
If this limit is reached and an additional connect request arrives, the DLS
provider must not pass the corresponding connect indication to the DLS user
until a response is received for an already outstanding indication.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND .
.TP
.I dl_correlation
conveys the correlation number to be used by the DLS user to associate this
message with the
.BR DL_CONNECT_RES "(7), " DL_DISCONNECT_REQ "(7), or " DL_DISCONNECT_IND
that is to follow.  This value, then, enables the DLS user to multi-thread
connect indications and responses.  All outstanding connect indications must
have a distinct, non-zero correlation value set by the DLS provider.
.TP
.I dl_called_addr_length
conveys the length of the address of the DLSAP for which this
.B DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive is intended.  This address is the full DLSAP address specified by
the calling DLS user and is typically the value returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7)
associated with the given stream.
.TP
.I dl_called_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the called DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_calling_addr_length
conveys the length of the address of the DLSAP from which the
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7)
primitive was sent.
.TP
.I dl_calling_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the calling DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_qos_length
conveys the range of quality of service parameter values desired by
the calling DLS user and negotiated by the DLS provider.  The range of
QOS values is conveyed in the appropriate structure defined in
.IR "\*(lqQOS Data Structures" , \*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
A full specification of these QOS parameters and rules for negotiating their
values is presented in
.IR "\*(lqQuality of Data Link Service" , \*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
For any parameter the DLS provider does not support or cannot determine,
the corresponding parameter values will be set to
.BR DL_UNKNOWN .
If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, this length field
will be set to zero.
.TP
.I dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the quality of service parameters begin.
.TP
.I dl_growth
defines a growth field for future enhancements to this primitive.  Its
value will be set to zero.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE ,
or state
.B DL_INCON_PENDING
when the maximum number of outstanding
.B DL_CONNECT_IND
primitives has not been reached on this stream.
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_INCON_PENDING ,
regardless of the current state.
.SH RESPONSE
The DLS user must eventually send either
.B DL_CONNECT_RES
to accept the connect request or
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (7)
to reject the connect request.  In either case, the responding message must
convey the correlation number received in the
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND .
The DLS provider will use the correlation number to identify the connect
request to which the DLS user is responding.
