.TH N_DISCON_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Network Provider Interface (NPI)"
.SH NAME
.B N_DISCON_REQ, N_disocn_req_t
\- Disconnect Request
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This user-originated primitive requests that the NS provider deny a request
for a network connection, or disconnect an existing connection.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block, followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks (for NS user data).  The NS user data may be lost if the NS
provider initiates release before the
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7)
is delivered.  Therefore, the NS user data parameter is present only if the
originator parameter (as discussed in
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7)
definition) indicates that the release was originated by an NS user.The NS
user may send any integral number of octets of data within a range supported
by the NS provider (see
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)).
The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;		/* always N_DISCON_REQ */
    ulong DISCON_reason;	/* reason */
    ulong RES_length;		/* responding address length */
    ulong RES_offset;		/* responding address offset */
    ulong SEQ_number;		/* sequence number */
} N_discon_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I DISCON_reason
Gives information about the cause of the release.

.TP
.I RES_length
Indicates the length of the address of the responding address parameter.  The
responding address parameter is an optional parameter, and is present in the
primitive only in the case where the primitive is used to indicate rejection
of an NC establishment attempt by an NS user.  The responding address parameter
conveys the network address of the NS user entity from which the
.B N_DISCON_REQ
was issued and under certain circumstances (e.g.  call redirection, generic
addressing, etc.) may be different from the "destination address" in the
corresponding
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7)
primitive.

.TP
.I RES_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the network address begins.

.TP
.I SEQ_number
When non-zero, it identifies the sequence number of the
.BR N_CONN_IND (7)
message being rejected.  This number is used by the NS provider to associate
the
.B N_DISCON_REQ
with an unacknowledged N_CONN_IND that is to be rejected.  If
the
.B N_DISCON_REQ
is rejecting a NC that is already established(or rejecting a
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7)
that the NS user had previously sent and has not yet been confirmed), then
this field should have a value of 0.
.SH STATE
.PP
This primitive is valid in states
.BR NS_WCON_CREQ ,
.BR NS_WRES_CIND ,
.BR NS_DATA_XFER ,
.BR NS_WCON_RREQ ,
.BR NS_WRES_RIND .
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The new state depends on the original state (see Appendix B, Table B-8).
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
The NS provider should generate one of the following acknowledgments upon
receipt of this primitive:
.HP
.B Successful:
Successful completion is indicated via the
.BR N_OK_ACK (7)
primitive.
.HP
.B Unsuccessful (Non-fatal errors):
Errors are indicated via the
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP
.RB [ NOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ NBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was outside the range supported by khe NS
provider.
.TP
.RB [ NSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ NBADSEQ ]
The specified sequence number referred to an invalid
.BR N_CONN_IND (7)
message, or the
.B N_DISCON_REQ
is rejecting an NC that is already established (or rejecting an
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7)
that the NS user had previously sent and has not yet been confirmed) and the
value of the sequence number is not 0.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR N_CONN_IND (7),
.BR N_CONN_REQ (7),
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7),
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7),
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)),
.BR N_OK_ACK (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
