.SH INTERFACE

.IR STREAMS ,

implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
function which invokes the
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine associated with
.IR q .
If there is no
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine associated with
.IR q ,
then
.BR qopen ()
returns
.RB [ ENOPKG ].
If
.BR mp-streams (9)
synchronization has been specified for the driver or module, the inner synchronization barrier is
entered shared or exlusive, according to the synchornization specification for the driver or module.
Otherwise, the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine is invoked directly.
.BR qopen ()
then returns the value returned by the driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
.PP
.BR qopen ()
accepts the same arguments as the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine defined for the driver or module,
and, with the exception of
.RB [ ENOPKG ],
returns the same error numbers as the driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
.PP
Since the
.BR qopen ()
function directly invokes the driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine, the description of the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
is also applicable to
.BR qopen ().
See
.BR qinit (9)
and
.IR qi_qopen (9)
for details.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that is not intended to be called
directly by the driver or module writer.  See
.BR open (2s)
and
.BR I_PUSH (7)
for indirect methods of invoking this function.  See
.IR qi_qopen (9)
for design guidelines for writing driver or module open routines.
This function is exported for
use by clone drivers and stream heads.  See
.BR register_inode (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qopen ()
returns zero (0) and the device number associated with a driver in the area
pointed to by
.IR devp .
Upon failure,
.BR qopen ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR qopen ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[EWOULDBLOCK]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOPKG ]
the module has no
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
.PP
.BR qopen ()
can also return any error returned by the modules
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.  In general,
the following errors are provided by module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routines:
.TP \w'[EWOULDBLOCK]\(em'u
.RB [ ENXIO ]
the
.IR qi_qopen ()
routine for the driver or module failed.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
a driver was opened as a module.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
a module was opened as a driver.
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
the opening process did not have sufficient credentials to open the specified
device or push the specified module.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
same as
.RB [ EACCES ]
above.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
memory could not be allocated to hold the driver or module's private
structures.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
a buffer could not be allocated as part of the open.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
same as
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
and
.RB [ ENOBUFS ],
above.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
a
.I STREAMS
resource could not be allocated as part of the open.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is only called by
.I STREAMS
in user context with the
.BR STRWOPEN
bit held in the Stream head private structure
.BR stdata (9),
(to prevent other simultaneous opens and closes of the same Stream),
and no locks held.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
If the driver or module has a
.BR mp-streams (9)
specification,
.BR qopen ()
will enter the inner synchronization barrier shared or exclusive (depending on the specification)
before invoking the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine for the driver or module.  Before return,
.BR qopen ()
will leave the inner synchronization barrier.
.PP
Otherwise, if the driver or module does not have a
.BR mp-streams (9)
specification, or does not specify an inner barrier,
the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine of the driver or module will be called directly.
.PP
See
.BR mp-streams (9),
for more information.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which was not intended to be called directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.
.BR qopen ()
is not part of the DDI/DKI and should not be called by portable programs.

.IP ""
.BR qopen ()
will not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules, and the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine of a driver or module will not be directly invoked.
