.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
is a
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
internal implementation specific function that
attaches the open
.I STREAMS
special device file pointed to by
.I file
to the file system path specified by
.IR path .
All file operations on file descriptors subsequently opened on
.I path
will operate on the attached
.I STREAMS
special device file, intead of the file or directory that originally corresponded to
.IR path .
This situation continues until the
.I STREAMS
special device file is detached from
.I path
with the
.BR do_fdetach (9)
call.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
is used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module, to emulate the
.BR fattach (2)
system call using the
.BR I_FATTACH (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
call.
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
has no other use or purpose, and will not be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules other than the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR do_fattach ()
attaches the Stream associated with
.I file
to the file named with
.I path
and returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure,
it returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR do_fattach ()
fails, the Stream is not mounted on the specified path, and
.BR do_fattach ()
returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I file
does not refer to an open Stream.
.TP
.RB [ ENOENT ]
.I path
is
.BR NULL
or is a null string.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
the calling user is not capable of mounting Streams.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
the calling user does not own the Stream to be mounted.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
insufficient memory was available to allocated the mount point within the filesystem.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I path
does specifies a path to a node over which a Stream cannot be mounted.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
.I path
specifies a path to a node over which a Stream has already been mounted.
.PP
Any error returned by
.BR path_lookup ().
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOENT ]
a component of
.I path
does not exist.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
a component of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.RB [ ELOOP ]
too many symbolic links encountered while traversing the path.
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
a component of
.I path
is too long (longer than
.BR MAXPATHLEN ).
.TP
.RB [ EACCES ]
a component of
.I path
was not searchable.
.PP
Any error returned by
.BR graft_tree ().
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
.I path
specifies a directory.
.IP ""
(This is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
bug:
.I SVR 4.2
allows Streams to be mounted on directories.)
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
can only be invoked in user process context.  Note that this does include kernel module
initialization and termination routines as well as
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
open routines
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
close routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
is an internal
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
function intended to provide the back-end to a
.B Linux
system call.
It is only exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
for
.BR ioctl (2s)
emulation of the
.BR fattach (2)
system call, when
.BR sth (4)
is configured as a separate loadable kernel module.  (The symbol need not be exported otherwise.)
.PP
.BR do_fattach ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules calling this function that exist outside the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
package, might be broken from verion to version and release to release.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B Linux
.BR graft_tree ()
has the limitation that if cannot mount a Stream over a directory.
This limitation is propagated into
.BR do_fattach (),
which calls
.BR graft_tree ().
.IR SVR 4.2
permits Streams to be mounted over directories.
