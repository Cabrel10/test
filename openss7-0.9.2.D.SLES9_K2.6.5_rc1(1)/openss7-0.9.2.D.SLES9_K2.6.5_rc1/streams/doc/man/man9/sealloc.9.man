.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I se
the
.B strevent
structure to free.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
allocate a deallocate a
.I STREAMS
event,
.B strevent
structure from and to memory cache.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
are used to allocate and deallocate a
.B strevent
structure.
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses
.BR strevent
structures for many things within the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.  The
.BR sth (4)
Stream head, on the other hand, only use them for allocating and deallocating structures to
represent the signals for which a process registers using the
.BR I_SETSIG (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
command.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR sefree ()
returns
.BR void .
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
returns a pointer to the allocated structure, or
.B NULL
on failure.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR sefree ()
always succeeds.
.BR sefree ()
passed an invalid pointer has indeterminate results.
When
.BR sealloc ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR sealloc ()
fails when the structure could not be allocated without sleeping.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
can be called from any context including process context, module procedure, callouts, callbacks,
soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
As
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
may result in the allocation or deallocation of a
.B strevent
structure, care should be taken invoking them from an ISR.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
use atomic allocators and are MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
are not intended to be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  They are only used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
within the
.I "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
See the source file
.I src/kernel/strsched.c
in the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution directory
for
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
implementation details.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
See the source file
.I src/modules/sth.c
in the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
distribution directory
for
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
example usage.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR sth (4),
.BR I_SETSIG (7),
.BR ioctl (2s).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
have no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
functions provide the ability to allocate and free
.I STREAMS
event,
.BR strevent ,
structures.  These are
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
implementation specific functions not intended to be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules and are not subject to standardization.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR sealloc ()
and
.BR sefree ()
are new for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
