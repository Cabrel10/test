\- \fISTREAMS\fP delay message
.\"

.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_DELAY
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_DELAY
message is a normal priority message that consists of one
.B M_DELAY
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_DELAY
message is generated by a module and sent to a media driver to request a real-time delay on output.
The data buffer associated with this message is expected to contain an integer to indicate the
number of machine ticks of delay desired.
.B M_DELAY
messages are typically used to prevent transmitted data from exceeding the buffering capacity of
slower terminals.
.PP
The message format is not defined by
.I STREAMS
and its use is developer dependent.  Not all media drivers understand this message.  This message
may be considered a special case of the
.BR M_CTL (9)
message.
.PP
.B M_DELAY
message cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_DELAY
message arriving at the
Stream head
will be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_DELAY
messages can be generated and consumed by drivers and modules.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_DELAY
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B M_DELAY

older versions of

and older versions of

Portable
