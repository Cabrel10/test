.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the transport user any relevant
protocol-dependent parameters.  It should be initiated in response to the
.BR T_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive described above.  The format of this message is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block.
.SH PARAMETERS
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
This indicates the primitive type.
.TP
.I TSDU_size
A value greater than zero specifies the maximum size of a transport
service data unit (TSDU); a value of zero specifies that the transport
provider does not support the concept of TSDU, although it does support
the sending of a data stream with no logical boundaries preserved across a
connection; a value of -1 specifies that there is no limit on the size of a
TSDU; and a value of -2 specifies that the transfer of normal data is not
supported by the transport provider.
.TP
.I ETSDU_size
A value greater than zero specifies the maximum size of an expedited
transport service data unit (ETSDU); a value of zero specifies that the
transport provider does not support the concept of ETSDU, although it
does support the sending of an expedited data stream with no logical
boundaries preserved across a connection; a value of -1 specifies that there
is no limit on the size of an ETSDU; and a value of -2 specifies that the
transfer of expedited data is not supported by the transport provider.
.TP
.I CDATA_size
A value greater than or equal to zero specifies the maximum amount of
data that may be associated with connection establishment primitives;
and a value of -2 specifies that the transport provider does not allow
data to be sent with connection establishment primitives.
.TP
.I DDATA_size
A value greater than or equal to zero specifies the maximum amount of
data that may be associated with the disconnect primitives; and a value
of -2 specifies that the transport provider does not allow data to be
sent with the disconnect primitives.
.TP
.I ADDR_size
A value greater than or equal to zero indicates the maximum size of a
transport protocol address; and a value of -2 specifies that the
transport provider does not provide user access to transport protocol
addresses.
.TP
.I OPT_size
A value greater than or equal to zero indicates the maximum number of
bytes of protocol-specific options supported by the provider; and a value
of -2 specifies that the transport provider does not support user-settable
options.
.TP
.I TIDU_size
This is the amount of user data that may be present in a single
.BR T_DATA_REQ "(7) or " T_EXDATA_REQ (7)
primitive.  This is the size of the transport protocol interface
data unit, and should not exceed the tunable system limit, if non-zero,
for the size of a STREAMS message.
.TP
.I SERV_type
This field specifies the service type supported by the transport
provider, and is one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B T_COTS
The provider service is connection oriented with no orderly release support.
.TP
.B T_COTS_ORD
The provider service is connection oriented with orderly release support.
.TP
.B T_CLTS
The provider service is a connectionless transport service.
.RE
.TP
.I CURRENT_state
This is the current state of the transport provider.
.TP
.I PROVIDER_flag
This field specifies additional properties specific to the transport
provider and may alter the way the transport user communicates.  The
following flags may be set by the provider:
.RS
.TP
.B SENDZERO
This flag indicates that the transport provider supports the sending of
zero-length TSDUs.
.TP
.B XPG4_1
This flag indicates that the transport provider supports XPG4 semantics.
.RE
.SH RULES
The following rules apply when the type of service is
.BR T_CLTS :
.IP - 3
The ETSDU_size, CDATA_size and DDATA_size fields should be -2.
.IP -
The TSDU_size should equal the TIDU_size.
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_INFO_REQ (7),
.BR T_ADDR_REQ (7),
.BR T_ADDR_ACK (7),
.BR T_CAPABILITY_REQ (7),
.BR T_CAPABILITY_ACK (7).

.PP
The Transport Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
