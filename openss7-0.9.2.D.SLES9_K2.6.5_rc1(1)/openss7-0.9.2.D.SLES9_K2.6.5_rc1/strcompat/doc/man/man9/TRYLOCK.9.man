.SH NAME
.B TRYLOCK
\- attempt to acquire a basic lock
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "pl_t TRYLOCK(lock_t *" lockp ", pl_t " pl );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the basic lock to attempt to acquire.
.TP
.I pl
A priority level to set if required before attempting to acquire the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR LOCK_ALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK_DEALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK (9),
.BR LOCK_OWNED (9),
.BR TRYLOCK (9)
and
.BR UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, locking,
testing, attempting to lock and unlocking a basic lock of type
.BR lock_t .
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
sets the priority level specified by the
.I pl
argument
using
.BR spl (9)
and then attempts to acquire the basic lock specified by the
.I lockp
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
If the lock cannot be acquired immediately,
.BR TRYLOCK ()
restores the previous interrupt priority level and returns a valud of
.BR invpl .
If the lock can be acquired immediately,
.BR TRYLOCK ()
returns the interrupt priority level prevailing at the time that
.BR TRYLOCK ()
was called.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is always successful.  If
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, the result will be
indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.PP
It is not necessary to raise the interrupt priority level using the
.I pl
argument if there is never an attempt to take a lock on
.I lockp
from an interrupt service routine context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Basic locks of type
.B lock_t
are not recursive.  Calling
.BR LOCK (9)
for a basic lock that has been acquired by the calling processor with
.BR LOCK (9)
or
.BR TRYLOCK (9)
will result in single party deadlock.
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is implemented by calling
.BR spl (9)
with the
.I pl
argument and then testing the lock with
.BR spin_trylock (9).
If
.I lockp
was unlocked, a lock was taken an the old interrupt priority level returned
from 
.BR spl (9)
is returned to the caller.
If
.I lockp
was locked, a value of
.B invpl
is returned.

.BR LOCK_ALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK_DEALLOC (9),
.BR LOCK_OWNED (9),
.BR TRYLOCK (9),
.BR UNLOCK (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR TRYLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR TRYLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR TRYLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
