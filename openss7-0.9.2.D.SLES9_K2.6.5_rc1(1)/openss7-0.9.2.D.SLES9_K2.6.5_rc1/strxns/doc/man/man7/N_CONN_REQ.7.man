.SH NAME
.B N_CONN_REQ, N_conn_req_t
\- network connection request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The format of the message is one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by one or more
.B M_DATA
blocks for the NS user data transfer.
The structure of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;		/* always N_CONN_REQ */
    ulong DEST_length;		/* destination address length */
    ulong DEST_offset;		/* destination address offset */
    ulong CONN_flags;		/* bit masking for options flags */
    ulong QOS_length;		/* QOS parameters' length */
    ulong QOS_offset;		/* QOS parameters' offset */
} N_conn_req_t;

/* Flags to indicate if options are requested */

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive requests that the NS provider make a network connection to the
specified destination.
.PP
The specification of the NS user data is optional.  The NS user can send any
integral number of octets of data within the range supported by the NS provider
(see
.BR N_INFO_ACK (7)).
If the user does not specify QOS parameter values, the default values
(specified via
.BR N_OPTMGMT_REQ (7))
are used by the NS provider.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I DEST_length
Indicates the length of the destination address parameter that conveys an
address identifying the NS user to which the NC is to be established.  This
field will accommodate variable length addresses within a range supported
by the NS provider.

.TP
.I DEST_offset
Is the offset of the destination address from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.

.TP
.I CONN_flags
Specifies the connection flags that are a bitwise OR of any of the following
flags:
.RS
.TP
.B REC_CONF_OPT
The receipt confirmation selection parameter indicates the use/availability of
the receipt confirmation service on the NC.  The receipt confirmation service
must be supported by the NS provider to be used on the NC.

.TP
.B EX_DATA_OPT
Indicates the use of the expedited data transfer service on the NC.  The
expedited data transfer service must be provided by the NS provider for it to
be used on the NC.
.RE

.TP
.I QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values that apply to the NC being
requested.  If the NS user cannot determine the value of a QOS parameter, its
value should be set to
.BR QOS_UNKNOWN .
If the NS user does not specify any QOS parameter values, the length of this
field should be set to zero.

.TP
.I QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block.
.SH STATE 
.PP
This primitive is valid in state
.BR NS_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
.PP
The new state is
.BR NS_WCON_CREQ .
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
The following acknowledgments are valid for this primitive:
.HP
.B Successful NC Establishment:
This is indicated via the
.BR N_CONN_CON (7)
primitive.  This results in the data transfer state.
.HP
.B Unsuccessful NC Establishment:
This is indicated via the
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7)
primitive.  For example, a connection may be rejected because either the called
NS user cannot be reached, or the NS provider and/or the called NS user did
not agree with the specified QOS.  This results in the idle state.
.HP
.B Non-fatal errors:
These are indicated via the
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
.TP
.RB [ NACCESS ]
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address
or options.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSPARAM ]
The QOS parameter values specified are outside the range supported by
the NS provider.
.TP
.RB [ NBADQOSTYPE ]
The QOS structure type is not supported by the NS provider.
.TP
.RB [ NBADADDR ]
The network address was in an incorrect format or contained illegal
information.  It is not intended to indicate NC errors, such as an unreachable
destination.  These errors types are indicated via the
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7)
primitive.
.TP
.RB [ NBADOPT ]
The options were in an incorrect format, or they contained illegal information.
.TP
.RB [ NOUTSTATE ]
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ NBADDATA ]
The amount of user data specified was outside the range supported by the NS
provider.
.TP
.RB [ NSYSERR ]
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the primitive.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Network Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
