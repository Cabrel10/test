.SH NAME
.B register_clone
\- register a clone minor
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "int register_clone(struct cdevsw *" cdev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to a character device switch table,
.BR cdevsw (9),
structure describing the
.I STREAMS
driver for which to create a clone device minor.
.PP
All characteristics of the device minor node and associated device driver are inherited from
.IR cdev ,
including the node name.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
create a new minor device node for the
.BR clone (4)
driver and registers the
.I STREAMS
device specified by
.I cdev
against that device minor using
.BR register_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is probably not the function that your want.  See
.BR register_strdev (9).
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is called automatically by
.BR register_strdev (9)
to register a new clone device minor
in the
.BR specfs (5)
file system for every
.I STREAMS
device driver registering for an external major character device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When successful,
.BR register_clone ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
when it fails, it returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR register_clone ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEWOULDBLOCK\fR]\(en'u
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
memory for the required
.BR devnode (9)
structure could not be allocated.
.PP
In addition,
.BR register_clone ()
can return any error number returned by
.BR register_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is intended to be called in a blockable process context during the loading of a
.I STREAMS
kernel module and as part of the initialization of that kernel module.
It may also be called at blockable process context as part of a
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is MP-safe when called from the proper context.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is a convenience function that simply allocates a
.BR devnode (9)
structure, populates it with values from
.IR cdev ,
and then registers the major device number of
.IR cdev
as a minor node of the
.BR clone_dev
.RB ( clone (4)
driver) using
.BR register_strnod (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific
function that is not intended to be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  This is certainly not the utility you need: see
.BR register_strdev (9)
and
.BR register_strnod (9).
.PP
Loadable kernel modules that call
.BR register_clone ()
when loading must call
.BR unregister_clone (9)
before unloading.
.BR unregister_clone (9)
must be called with the same value of
.I cdev
with which the corresponding
.BR register_clone ()
was called.
.PP
Clone minor device nodes registered with
.BR register_clone ()
will appear as a clone minor device node in the device directory
.BR /dev/streams/clone ,
when the
.BR specfs (5)
file system has been mounted on
.BR /dev/streams .
The clone minor device node will be named
.BI /dev/streams/clone/ name\fR,
where
.I name
is the
.I d_name
field of the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure referenced by
.IR cdev .
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
function that is provided by the
.BR clone (4)
driver and used by the
.BR register_strdev (9)
function.
.PP
If you use
.BR register_clone ()
from outside of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package, your code may break on the next release.
Do not use
.BR register_clone ():
use
.BR register_strdev (9)
or
.BR register_strnod (9)
instead.
.\"

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
None.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR register_strdev (9),
.BR register_strnod (9),
.BR unregister_clone (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR register_clone ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function with support for the mountable
.BR specfs (5)
file system.  Registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules is inherently implementation specific and non-portable.
Different implementations provide different mechanisms.
The
.BR strcompat (5)
package for
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides additional mechanisms compatible with other implementations.
See also
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Registration and de-registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers is implementation specific and not subject to standardization.
.BR register_clone ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function.
