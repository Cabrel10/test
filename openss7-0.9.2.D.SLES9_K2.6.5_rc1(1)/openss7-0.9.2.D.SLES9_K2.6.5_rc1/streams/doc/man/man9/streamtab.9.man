.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B streamtab
structure, defined in
.RB < sys/stream.h >,
is the principal structure used to define a
.I STREAMS
driver or module.  A reference to the
.B streamtab
structure is a unique reference to the driver or module.
.PP
The
.B streamtab
structure and associated
.BR qinit (9),
.BR module_info (9),
and
.BR module_stat (9),
structures, provide the complete definition for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.PP
All modules only specify the first two members
.RI ( st_rdinit
and
.IR st_wrinit )
of the structure and leave the remaining two
.BR NULL .
(The remaining two are ignored by
.I STREAMS
for modules, regardless of their values.)
These two
.BR qinit (9)
structures are used to initialize the
.BR queue (9)
structures in the queue pair when an instance of the module is created with the
.BR I_PUSH (7)
command to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
.PP
A
.I STREAMS
driver without a lower multiplex specification also only specifies the first two members in the same
manner as a module.  The first two
.BR qinit (9)
structures are used by
.I STREAMS
to initialize the
.BR queue (9)
strucutures in the queue pair when an instance of the driver is created using the
.BR open (2s)
system call.
Drivers not supporting a lower multiplex (that is, drivers that do not support the
.BR I_LINK (7)
or
.BR I_PLINK (7)
operations) must specify
.B NULL
for the last two members
.RI ( st_muxrinit
and
.IR st_muxwinit )
of the structure.
.PP
A multiplexing
.I STREAMS
driver can have both an upper-multiplex specification that is used for Streams that are created
using the
.BR open (2s)
system call, as well as a lower-multiplex specification that is used for Streams that are
linked under the multiplexing driver using the
.BR I_LINK (7)
or
.BR I_PLINK (7)
commands to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
Multiplexing drivers supporting the linking of Streams to a lower multiplex must specify
.BR qinit (9)
structures for the
.I st_muxrinit
and
.I st_muxwinit
members.
These
.BR qinit (9)
structures will be used to reinitialize the
.BR queue (9)
structures in the queue pair formerly associated with the Stream head of the linked Stream during
the
.BR I_LINK (9)
or
.BR I_PLINK (9)
operation.
.PP
Once defined, the
.B streamtab
structure must be registered with the
.I STREAMS
subsystem for the driver or module to be available for use in the
.BR GNU/Linux
system.  Registration can be effected using
.BR register_strmod (9),
for a module;
and,
.BR register_strdev (9),
for a device or pseudo-device driver.
.PP
Once registered, the
.B streamtab
structure is used by
.I STREAMS
when created an instance of a driver or module, also when linking a Stream beneath a multiplexing
driver.
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.I STREAMS
creates an instance of a driver (as a result of a call to
.BR open (2s)),
by first creating and initializing the Stream head queue pair.  Next the driver (Stream end)
queue pair is created and initialized using the
.I st_rdinit
and
.I st_wrinit
initialization structures and the queue pair is attached beneath the Stream head with
.BR qattach (9).
.IP \(bu
.I STREAMS
creates an instance of a module (as a result of a call to
.BR ioctl (2s)
with the
.BR I_PUSH (7)
command), by creating and initializing a queue pair from the
.I st_rdinit
and
.I st_wrinit
initialization structure.  The queue pair is then inserted beneath the Stream head with
.BR qattach (9).
.IP \(bu
.I STREAMS
links a Stream under a multiplexing driver (as a result of a call to
.BR ioctl (2s)
with the
.BR I_LINK (7)
or
.BR I_PLINK (7)
command), by reinitializing the Stream head queue pair of the linked Stream from the
.I st_muxrinit
and
.I st_muxwinit
initialization structures.
.PP
See
.BR qinit (9)
and
.BR queue (9)
for details.

.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B streamtab
structure is statically allocated and associated with statically allocated
.BR qinit (9)
structures to define a
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.PP
Once the
.B streamtab
has been registered with the
.I STREAMS
subsystem, using a registration function such as
.BR register_strmod (9)
or
.BR register_strdev (9),
all fields in the structure must be treated as read-only by a driver or module.  The following
guidelines pertain to the use of the fields in the
.B streamtab
structure:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Function pointers
.IR st_rdinit ,
.IR st_wrinit ,
.IR st_muxrinit ,
and
.IR st_muxwinit ,
must not be altered after the
.B streamtab
structure has been registered, and before it is unregistered.
.IP \(bu
The members of the structure may be read by a driver or module to locate the attached
.BR qinit (9)
structures when there exists no
.BR queue (9)
structure reference that can be used to locate them.
For rules for accessing the members of the
.BR qinit (9)
structure, see
.BR qinit (9).
.IP \(bu
When the
.B streamtab
structure is contained within a loadable kernel module, and the
.I STREAMS
subsystem holds a reference to the
.B streamtab
structure,  the loadable kernel module must not be unloaded from the system.  The registration
functions provide a mechanism for ensuring this.  See
.BR register_strmod (9)
and
.BR register_strdev (9)
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
The
.B streamtab
structure can be read from any context.  Members of the
.B streamtab
structure should only be modified before registration or after de-registration of the structure with
the
.I STREAMS
subsystem.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
Since the
.B streamtab
structure must be treated as read-only, and provisions are made to disable module unloaded when
a reference to the structure exists, functions that properly access the structure are MP-safe by
definition.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

The

structure is compatible with

.[

.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.B streamtab
structure is compatible across all
.I STREAMS
implementations.  There are no portability issues.
.IP ""
On the other hand, mechanisms for registering the
.B streamtab
structure with the
.I STREAMS
implementation vary widely from implementation to implementation.  See
.BR register_strmod (9)
and
.BR register_strdev (9)
for more information.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
