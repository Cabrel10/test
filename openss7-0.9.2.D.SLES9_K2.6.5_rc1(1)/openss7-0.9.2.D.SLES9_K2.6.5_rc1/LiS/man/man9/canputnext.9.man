.SH NAME

\- test flow control on a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int canputnext(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue upstream of the queue to test for flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
module putting a band zero (0)
non-priority message to a subsequent message queue to check for flow control
using
.BR canputnext ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR putnext (9).
.PP
.BR canputnext ()
checks whether the stream is flow controlled starting at the
queue next from the specified queue,
.IR q .
Starting at the queue next from the
.I q
specified
.BR canputnext ()
looks for the next foward queue which has a service routine or which has no
further forward queue.
.PP
If this forward queue has the
.B QFULL
flag clear indicating that the queue is not full, then
.BR canputnext ()
will return true (1).
.PP
If this foward queue has the
.B QFULL
flag is set indicating that the queue if full, then
.BR canputnext ()
will return false (0).
.PP
When
.BR canputnext ()
returns false (0), it also sets the
.B QWANTW
flag for the queue indicating that the
.I STREAMS
executive should backenable the
service procedures feeding the flow controlled queue once the flow controlled
queue is no longer full (i.e. message have been read from the queue to reduce
the queue size below the low water mark for the queue).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR canputnext ()
will return false (0) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow
controlled and return true (1) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not
flow controlled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR canputnext ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR canputnext ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
Under
.BR LiS ,
.BR canputnext ()
is not MP-safe.
.PP
Although
.BI canput( q->q_next )
is functionally equivalent to
.BI bcanputnext( q ),
for the
.BR canput (9)
form, the dereference of the
.I q->q_next
pointer is not protected on MP architectures and may change as a result of a
concurrent reconfiguration of the stream (e.g. an
.BR I_PUSH " or " I_POP
.BR streamio (7)
operation).
For MP operation,
.BI canput( q->q_next )
should not be called and
.BR canputnext ()
should always be called instead.
.PP
Because
.B LiS
violates this condition,
.BR canputnext ()
is not MP-safe under
.BR LiS .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
In the
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implementation, if
.BR canputnext ()
suffers an internal error, it will return false (0).
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
\fB\)canput(\fI\)q\fB\))\fR\),
\fB\)canputnext(\fI\)q\fB\))\fR\) and
\fB\)bcanputnext(\fI\)q\fB\), \fI\)band\fB\))\fR\)
with a macros that call
\fB\)bcanput(\fI\)q\fB\), \fI\)band\fB\))\fR\).
This does not protect the
.I q->q_next
dereference and can cause problems when modules are being pushed onto or
popped from running streams.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR canputnext ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR canputnext ()
should explicitly protect dereferencing of the
.I q->q_next
pointer with the stream head read lock that prevents reconfiguration of the
stream during the call.
.B LiS
does not explicitly protect this dereference.
.IP \(em
.BR canputnext ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer or a
.I q
pointer that has an invalid
.I q->q_next
pointer, will have undefined results and may crash or destabilize the kernel.
LiS will return false (0) under the same conditions.
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers that always obtain
.I q
from a pointer passed by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler via
.BR qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR put (9),
.BR srv (9),
(as is normal) will not encounter this problem.
.IP \(em
.BR canputnext ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[

.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[

.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR canputnext ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR canputnext ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
