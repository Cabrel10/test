.SH NAME 
.B T_OPTMGMT_ACK
\- Option Management Acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of a
.B M_PCPROTO
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct T_optmgmt_ack {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_OPTMGMT_ACK */
    t_scalar_t   OPT_length;
    t_scalar_t   OPT_offset;
    t_scalar_t   MGMT_flags;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This indicates to the transport user that the options management request has
completed.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
indicates the primitive type
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the protocol options associated with the primitive
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
block where the options begin.
.PP
The proper alignment of the options is not guaranteed.  MGMT_flags should be
the same as those specified in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive with any additional flags as specified below.
.SH RULES
The following rules apply to the
.B T_OPTMGMT_ACK
primitive.:
.IP - 3
If the value of
.I MGMT_flags
in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive is
.BR T_DEFAULT ,
the provider should return the default provider options without changing the
existing options associated with the stream.
.IP -
If the value of
.I MGMT_flags
in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive is
.BR T_CHECK ,
the provider should return the options as specified in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive along with the additional flags
.BR T_SUCCESS " or " T_FAILURE
which indicate to the user whether the specified options are supportable
by the provider.  The provider should not change any existing options
associated with the stream.
.IP -
If the value of
.I MGMT_flags
in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive is
.BR T_NEGOTIATE ,
the provider should set and negotiate the option as specified by the following
rules:
.RS
.IP - 3
If the
.I OPT_length
field of the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive is 0, then the transport provider is to set and return the default
options associated with the stream in the
.B T_OPTMGMT_ACK
primitive.
.IP -
If options are specified in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive, then the transport provider should negotiate those options,
set the negotiated options and return the negotiated options in the
.B T_OPTMGMT_ACK
primitive.  It is the user's responsibility to check the negotiated options
returned in the
.B T_OPTMGMT_ACK
primitive and take appropriate action.
.RE
.IP - 3
If the value of
.I MGMT_flags
in the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive is
.BR T_CURRENT ,
the provider should return the currently effective option values without
changing any existing options associated with the stream.
.SH ERRORS
If the above rules result in an error condition, the transport provider
must issue a
.BR T_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive to the transport user specifying the error as defined in the
description of the
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive. 
.SH MODES
Both connection-mode and connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport provider.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_OPTMGMT_REQ (7).

.PP
The Transport Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
