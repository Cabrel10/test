.SH SYNOPSIS

.B insmod lfscompat.o
.\"
.\"
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I LfS Compatibility Module
is a
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
LfS
.]
The
.I LfS Compatibility Module
is provided for source compatibility with
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules compiled as
.B Linux
kernel modules.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Many of the symbols provided by
.I LiS
are inefficient wrappers for
.B Linux
kernel functions.
New
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should always be compiled against
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
and
.I Linux
symbols for performance and efficiency.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Many of the SVR 4.2
.I STREAMS
functions provided by
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
contain bugs.  The symbols provided by the
.I LfS Compatibility Module
are not bug-for-bug compatible with
.I LiS\c
.
.[
LiS
.]
This means that incorrect
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules that appear to run
correctly under
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
may fail to operate with the
.IR "LfS Compatibility Module" .
.\"
.\"
.PP
.I LiS
can permit erroneous
.I STREAMS
functions to appear to run correctly.
Conversely,
.I LfS Compatibility Module
functions are unforgiving of being passed
.B NULL
pointers and out of range arguments.
This means that incorrect
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules that appear to run
correctly under
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
may fail to operate with the
.IR "LfS Compatibility Module" .
