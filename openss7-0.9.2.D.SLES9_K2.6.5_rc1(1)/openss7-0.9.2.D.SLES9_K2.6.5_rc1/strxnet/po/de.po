#. TRANS No error is indicated in the t_errno variable.  The last operation was a
#. TRANS success.  t_errno will not be set to this value (zero) by the library,
#. TRANS the user must set t_errno to zero before the XTI library call an when
#. TRANS the call is successful, the t_errno value will be unaffected.  There is
#. TRANS no requirement that this value be set after a successful call, and calls
#. TRANS are even permitted to change t_errno to some other value, when the call
#. TRANS is actually successful.

#. TRANS The arguments of the XTI library call are correct, however, the

#. TRANS When a transport connection indication is received it is given a

#. TRANS The user provided a buffer to the XTI library call into which to receive

#. TRANS The user called a send function that would have otherwise blocked due to
#. TRANS flow control, however, O_NONBLOCK was set on the file descriptor.  This

msgstr ""

#. TRANS Some XTI library calls can only be used on connection-oriented transport
#. TRANS service providers, others only on connection-oriented transport service
#. TRANS providers with orderly release, others only on connectionless transport
#. TRANS service providers.  In addition, some messages exchanged with the
#. TRANS underlying transport service provider might not be supported by that
#. TRANS provider.  This message indications that the user has called an XTI

msgid "Not supported"
msgstr ""

#. TRANS Most XTI library calls require the transport endpoint state machine to
#. TRANS be in a given state.  Due to parallel events, the transport endpoint
#. TRANS state machine can be changing state when an XTI library function is
