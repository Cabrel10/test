.TH ISASTREAM 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B isastream
\- determine whether an open file is \fISTREAMS\fR
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B "#include <stropts.h> "
.HP
.BI "int isastream( int " filedes " ); "
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I filedes
a file descriptor to test.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR isastream "() "
may be used to test whether or not an open file descriptor is for a
.I STREAMS
file (see
.IR STREAMS "(4)).  "
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion,
.BR isastream "() "
returns 1 if the indicated file is a
.IR STREAM ,
and 0 if it is not.
.\"
.\"
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.PP
If
.I filedes
does not identify a valid open file,
.BR isastream "() "
should return -1 with
.I errno
set to
.RB [ EBADF ].
.\"
.\"
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.PP
.BR isastream "() " 
is convenient under Linux for determining or at least estimating
a file's behavior, since (with Linux
.I STREAMS
being available) there are both
.I STREAMS
and
.RI "non-" STREAMS
implementations for, e.g.,
.I fifos
(also known as
.I "named pipes"
- see
.BR fifo "(4)) "
and
.I pipes
(see
.BR pipe "(3)).  "
.sp
.BR isastream "() "
is also useful in conjunction with
.BR fattach "(3) "
and
.BR fdetach "(3) "
to determine whether or not a
.I STREAMS
file has been attached to a path name.
.sp
Applications wishing to use the version of the
.BR isastream "() "
function described herein must link with the
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
library which provides it.  The Linux/GNU C library otherwise provides a stub
supporting calls to
.BR isastream "() "
which only generates an error indicating that it is not implemented.
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR isastream ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
None.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
