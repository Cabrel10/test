.TH T_UNITDATA_REQ 7 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "Transport Provider Interface (TPI)"
.SH NAME
.B T_UNITDATA_REQ
\- Unitdata Request
.SH SYNOPSIS
This message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block followed by zero or more
.B M_DATA
message blocks where each
.B M_DATA
message block contains zero or more bytes of data.  The format of the
.B M_PROTO
message block is as follows:
.nf
.fi
\fC\s-1\
struct T_unitdata_req {
    t_scalar_t   PRIM_type;      /* Always T_UNITDATA_REQ */
    t_scalar_t   DEST_length;
    t_scalar_t   DEST_offset;
    t_scalar_t   OPT_length;
    t_scalar_t   OPT_offset;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive requests that the transport provider send the specified
datagram to the specified destination.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I DEST_length
is the length of the destination address
.TP
.I DEST_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block) where the destination address begins. 
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the requested options associated with the primitive.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offset (from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block) of the requested options associated with the primitive. 
.PP
The proper alignment of the destination address and options in the
.B M_PROTO
message block is not guaranteed.  The destination address and options in the
.B M_PROTO
message block are, however, aligned the same as they were received from the
transport user. 
.PP
This primitive does not require any acknowledgment.  If a non-fatal error
occurs, it is the responsibility of the transport provider to report it via
the
.BR T_UDERROR_IND (7)
indication.  Fatal errors are indicated via a
.B M_ERROR
message type which results in the failure of all operating system service
routines on the stream. 
.SH ERRORS
The allowable fatal errors are as follows:
.TP 16
.RB [ EPROTO ]
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
.IP - 3
The transport service interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
.IP -
The amount of transport user data associated with the primitive defines an
transport service data unit larger than that allowed by the transport
provider.
.SH MODES
Only connectionless-mode.
.SH ORIGINATOR
Transport user.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR T_UNITDATA_IND (7),
.BR T_UDERROR_IND (7).
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The Transport Provider Interface first appeared in SVR 4.
