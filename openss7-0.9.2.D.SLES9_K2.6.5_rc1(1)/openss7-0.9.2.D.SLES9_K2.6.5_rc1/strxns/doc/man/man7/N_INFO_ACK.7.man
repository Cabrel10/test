.SH NAME
.B N_INFO_ACK, N_info_ack_t
\- network information acknowledgement
.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the NS user any relevant protocol-dependent
parameters.  (Note: In the future, this primitive will be modified such that
it will allow the NPI to accept either sub-network point of attachment
addresses or network addresses.) It should be initiated in response to the
.BR N_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The format of this message is one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block and its structure is as follows:

.SH PARAMETERS
The above fields have the following meaning:
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I NSDU_size
Specifies the maximum size (in octets) of a Network Service Data Unit (NSDU)
supported by the NS provider.

.TP
.I ENSDU_size
Specifies the maximum size (in octets) of an Expedited Network Service Data
Unit (ENSDU) supported by the NS provider.

.TP
.I CDATA_size
Specifies the maximum number of octets of data that may be associated with
connection establishment primitives.

.TP
.I DDATA_size
Specifies the maximum number of octets of data that may be associated with the
disconnect primitives.

.TP
.I ADDR_size
Specifies the maximum size (in decimal digits) of a network address.

.TP
.I ADDR_length
Specifies the length in bytes of the network address bound on the
.I STREAM
on which the
.BR N_INFO_REQ (7)
was issued (a network address is bound to a
.I STREAM
via a
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)).

.TP
.I ADDR_offset
Specifies the offset of the bound network address from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block (this field should be ignored if the
.I ADDR_length
field is zero).

.TP
.I QOS_length
in an addendum to this document.  In the connection-mode environment, when this
primitive is invoked before the NC is established on the stream, the values
returned specify the default values supported by the NS provider.  When this
primitive is invoked after a NC has been established on the stream, the values
returned indicate the negotiated values for the QOS parameters.  In the
connection-less environment, these values represent the default or the
selected QOS parameter values.  In case a QOS parameter is not supported by the
NS Provider, a value of
.B QOS_UNKNOWN
will be returned.  In the case where no QOS parameters are supported by the NS
provider, this field will be zero.

.TP
.I QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block.

.TP
.I QOS_range_length
Indicates the length in bytes, of the available range of QOS parameters
values supported by the NS provider.  These ranges are used by the NS user to
select QOS parameter values that are valid with the NS provider.  QOS parameter
values are selected, or the default values altered via the
.BR N_OPTMGMT_REQ (7)
primitive.  In the connection-mode environment, the values for end-to-end QOS
parameters may be specified with
the
.B N_CONN
primitives for negotiation.  If the NS provider does not support a certain QOS
parameter, its value will be set to
.BR QOS_UNKNOWN .
In the case where no QOS parameters are supported by the NS provider, the
length of this field will be zero.

.TP
.I QOS_range_offset
Indicates the offset of the range of QOS parameter values from the beginning of
the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block.

.TP
.I OPTIONS_flags
Defines flags that indicate whether the options described below are supported
by the NS provider.  The possible options are receipt confirmation, expedited
data and default selection for use of receipt confirmation.
.RS

.TP
.B REC_CONF_OPT
When set, it indicates that the NS provider supports receipt confirmation.
This flag is used only in the connection-mode environment.

.TP
.B EX_DATA_OPT
When set, it indicates that the NS provider supports expedited data transfer.
This flag is used only in the connection-mode environment.

.TP
.B DEFAULT_RC_SEL
When set, it indicates that the default selection is for the use of receipt
confirmation for every
.BR N_DATA_REQ (7)
primitive (This parameter is applicable only when use of receipt confirmation
is successfully negotiated via the
.B N_CONN
primitives).  This flag is used only in the connection-mode environment.
.RE

.TP
.I NIDU_size
This indicates the amount of user data that may be present in a
.B N_DATA
primitive.  The
.I NIDU_size
should not be larger than the NSDU_size specification.

.TP
.I SERV_type
Specifies the service type supported by the NS provider.  The possible values
can be
.BR N_CONS ,
.BR N_CLNS ,
(or both as indicated by using
.BR N_CONS|N_CLNS ).
.RS

.TP
.B N_CONS
When set, it indicates that the NS provider supports connection-mode
network services.

.TP
.B N_CLNS
When set, it indicates that the NS provider supports connection-less network
services.
.RE

.TP
.I CURRENT_state
This indicates the current state of the NS provider.

.TP
.I PROVIDER_type
This indicates the type of NS provider.  The possible values can be
.B N_SNICFP
or
.BR N_SUBNET .
The value
.B N_SNICFP
indicates that the provider is the Subnetwork Independent Convergence
Function/Protocol sub-layer of the network layer.  The value
.B N_SUBNET
indicates that the provider is a subnetwork.

.TP
.I NODU_size
This specifies the optimal NSDU size (in octets) of an NSDU given the current
routing information.

.TP
.I PROTOID_length
This specifies the length of the protocol ids that were bound using the
.BR N_BIND_REQ .

.TP
.I PROTOID_offset
This specifies the offset of the protocol ids that were bound using the
.BR N_BIND_REQ .

.TP
.I NPI_version
This indicates the current version of NPI that is supported.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in any state in response to a
.BR N_INFO_REQ (7)
primitive.
SH "NEW STATE"
The state remains the same.
