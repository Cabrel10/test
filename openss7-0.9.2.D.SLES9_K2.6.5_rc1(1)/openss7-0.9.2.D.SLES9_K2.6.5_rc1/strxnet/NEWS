* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.9.rc2

  Second release candidate.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.9rc1

  Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.9

  Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
  Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.
  Added buffer leak checks to all testsuites (Linux Fast-STREAMS only)

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.8

  This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
  architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
  distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

  This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
  x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to
  handle __LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15
  kernels as reported on mailing list.  Corrects one bug from
  inspection.

  - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to
    support 32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.
    Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At the same
    time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of
    the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

  - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

  - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
    x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
    compiler warnings.

  - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
    mailing list.

  - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
    Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
    N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

  - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
    x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

  This is a public gamma release of the package.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.7

  This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified
  (conformance test suite passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS
  (streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated because LiS was not
  operating correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error
  contrary to POSIX).

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2.6

  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
  version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.
  All `RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all
  `Debian' release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches
  and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply
  a suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
  release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
  source in the `.dsc' file.

  Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
  and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
  distribution support.  The package also supports both `LiS-2.18.1' as
  well as `streams-0.7a' on both kernels.

  Removed `XNS' kernel modules, header files and documentation to a
  separate `strxns-0.9.2-1' package and `INET' kernel modules, header
  files and documentation to a separate `strinet-0.9.2-1' package.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-5

  Dropped RPM epoch to 0 from 1 in preparation for RPM release.  Bumped
  RPM release to 5.

  Minor corrections: made `SCTP' manpages conditional on `OpenSS7 SCTP'
  kernel.

  Updated documentation and provided improvements to build process
  applied to other packages.  This includes improvements to creation of
  `info' and `pdf' manuals.  Update `tirdwr' and `timod' manpage.

  Removed INET package from `strxnet-0.9.2-5' release.  This has now
  been moved to the `strxns-0.9.2'(1) package.  Removed XNS header files
  and manual pages for CDI, DLPI and NPI to that package.  Also removed
  `test-inet_raw', `test-inet_udp' and `test-inet_tcp' test programs to
  that package.  Removed `/dev/inet' driver to that package.  Stripped
  out the -dev- RPM subpackage as there are no devices left in the
  package.  Adjusted the virtual package provides naming to a more
  rational approach.  Adjusted kernel module installation process to
  accomodate.

  Genksyms now generates kernels symbols for all combinations of SMP and
  CONFIG_REGPARM kernels allowing a single modversions header file.
  Improved manpages `automake' file fragment (`am/man.am') to accomodate
  top-level manual pages (this was really for the `netperf' release).

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-4

  Changes to compile, install.  Now builds rpms for `Fedora Core 1
  (FC1)', `Whitebox Enterprise Linux (WBEL)' and `RedHat Enterprise
  Linux (EL3)'.

  Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in `.spec' file for
  RPM versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection
  and moved `getpmsg' and `putpmsg' manual pages.

  Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during
  non-rpm `autoconf' installation.

  Correction to zero maxlen behavior in `t_rcvconnect()'.

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-3

  Added check for CONFIG_REGPARM, addition of `-mregparm=3' CFLAGS,
  addition of `regparm_' prefix for exported kernel symbols.

  Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and
  caching of detected kernel symbols.

  Added an option for suppression of exported symbol versioning
  (`--without-modversions').

* Major changes in strxnet-0.9.2-2

  A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.
  Changed order of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so
  that the rpm debug package is build correctly on `RedHat 9'.

  Changed MODULE_PARM to static so that `make install-strip' does not
  strip module parameter symbols.

* Initial release strxnet-0.9.2-1

  Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strxnet' release.
