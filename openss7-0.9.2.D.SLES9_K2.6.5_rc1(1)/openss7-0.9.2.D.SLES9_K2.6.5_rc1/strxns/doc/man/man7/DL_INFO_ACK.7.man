.TP
.B DL_OTHER
Any other medium that is not listed above.
.I dl_mac_type
values above 0x80000000 are available for private or experimental use and will
not be defined by this Specification.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_reserved
is a reserved field whose value must be set to zero.
.TP
.I dl_current_state
conveys the state of the DLPI interface for the stream when the DLS provider
issued this acknowledgement.  See
.I \*(lqAllowable Sequence of DLPI Primitives,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7),
for a list of DLPI states and an explanation of each.
.TP
.I dl_sap_length
indicates the current length of the SAP component of the DLSAP address.  It
may have a negative, zero or positive value.  A positive value indicates
the ordering of the SAP and PHYSICAL component within the DLSAP address as SAP
component followed by PHYSICAL component.  A negative value indicates
PHYSICAL followed by the SAP.  A zero value indicates that no SAP has yet been
bound.  The absolute value of the
.I dl_sap_length
provides the length of the SAP component within the DLSAP address.
.TP
.I dl_service_mode
if returned before the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7)
is processed, this conveys which service modes (
connection-mode,connectionless-mode or acknowledged connectionless-mode, or
any comibination of these modes) the DLS provider can support.  It contains a
bit-mask specifying one or more than one of the following values:
.RS
.TP 12
.B DL_CODLS
connection-oriented data link service
.TP
.B DL_CLDLS
connectionless data link service
.TP
.B DL_ACLDLS
acknowledged connectionless data link service.
.PP
Once a specific service mode has been bound to the stream, this field returns
that specific service mode.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_qos_length
conveys the length, in bytes, of the negotiated/selected values of the
quality of service (QOS) parameters.  Section 5, Quality of Data Link
Service , describes quality of service and its associated parameters
completely.  For connection-mode service, the returned values are those
agreed during negotiation.  For connectionless-mode service, the values are
those currently selected by the DLS user.  If quality of service has not
yet been negotiated, default values will be returned; these values correspond
to those that will be applied by the DLS provider on a connect request in
connection-mode service, or those that will be applied to each data
unit transmission in connectionless-mode service.  If the DLS provider
supports both connection-mode and connectionless-mode services but the DLS
user has not yet bound a specific service mode, the DLS provider
may return either connection-mode or connectionless-mode QOS
parameter values.
.RS
.PP
The QOS values are conveyed in the structures defined in
.I \*(lqQOS Data Structures,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
For any parameter the DLS provider does not support or cannot
determine, the corresponding entry will be set to
.BR DL_UNKNOWN .
If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, this length field
will be set to zero.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
block where the current quality of service parameters begin.
.TP
.I dl_qos_range_length
conveys the length, in bytes, of the available range of QOS parameter
values supported by the DLS provider.  Forconnection-mode
service, this is the range available to the calling DLS user in a connect
request.  Forconnectionless-mode, this is the range available for each data
unit transmission.  If the DLS provider supports both
connection-mode and connectionless-mode services but the DLS user has not
yet bound a specific service mode, the DLS provider may return either
connection-mode or connectionless-mode QOS parameter values.
.RS
.PP
The range of available QOS values is conveyed in the structures defined in
.I \*(lqQOS Data Structures,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7).
For any parameter the DLS provider does not support or cannot determine, the
corresponding entry will be set
to
.BR DL_UNKNOWN .
If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, this length field
will be set to zero.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_qos_range_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
block where the available range of quality of service parameters begins.
.TP
.I dl_provider_style
conveys the style of DLS provider associated with the DLPI stream (see
.I \*(lqPhysical Attachment Identification,\*(rq
.BR dlpi (7)).
The following provider classes are defined:
.RS
.TP 12
.B DL_STYLE1
The PPA is implicitly attached to the DLPI stream by opening the
appropriate major/minor device number.
.TP
.B DL_STYLE2
The DLS user must explicitly attach a PPA to the DLPI stream using
.BR DL_ATTACH_REQ (7).
.PP
DLS users implemented in a protocol-independent manner must access this
parameter to determine whether the DLS attach service must be invoked
explicitly.
.RE
.TP
.I dl_addr_offset
conveys the offset of the address that is bound to the associated
stream.  If the DLS user issues a
.BR DL_INFO_REQ (7)
prior to binding a DLSAP, the value of
.I dl_addr_len
will be 0 and consequently indicate that there has been no address bound.
.TP
.I dl_version
indicates the current version of the dlpi that is supported.
.TP
.I dl_brdcst_addr_length
indicates the length of the physical broadcast address.
.TP
.I dl_brdcst_addr_offset
indicates the offset of the physical broadcast address from the beginning of
the
.B M_PCPROTO
block.
.TP
.I dl_growth
conveys a growth field for future use.  The value of this field will be zero.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in any state in response to a
.BR DL_INFO_REQ .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is unchanged.
.SH NOTES
Readers should note that the list of data links supported by the interface
may be augmented and is published on the World-Wide Web in U019 at
http://www.xopen.org (under Sales and Ordering).  This Corrigendum will
contain relevant additional information such as recognised
implementors' agreements/guidelines for common data link providers.
