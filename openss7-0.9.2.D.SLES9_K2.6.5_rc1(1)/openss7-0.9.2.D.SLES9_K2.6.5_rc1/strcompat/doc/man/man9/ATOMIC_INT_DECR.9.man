.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "int ATOMIC_INT_DECR(atomic_int_t *" counter );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'counter\(em'u
.I counter
A pointer to the
.B atomic_int_t
to be decremented and tested.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_ALLOC "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_DEALLOC "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_INIT (9),
.BR ATOMIC_INT_READ "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_WRITE "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_ADD (9),
.BR ATOMIC_INT_SUB "(9), " ATOMIC_INT_INCR "(9) and " ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
are a set of functions used to allocate, deallocate, initialize, read from,
write to, add to, subtract from, increment or decrement an integer value in an
atomic fashion.  These functions operate on the
.B atomic_int_t
which is an opaque type representing an integer that is manipulated in an
atomic fashion by these functions.
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
decrements the value of an atomic integer and tests for zero.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
returns true (1) if the decrement of the
.B atomic_int_t
referenced by the
.I counter
argument results in the atomic integer being decremented to zero.
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
returns false (0) if the result is non-zero.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
is always successful.
The
.B atomic_int_t
referenced by the
.I counter
argument is decremented.
If incorrect arguments are supplied, the result will be indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
simply calls the
.B Linux
kernel function
.BR atomic_dec_and_test (9).
.\"
.\"

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
has no known bugs.

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR ATOMIC_INT_DECR ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
