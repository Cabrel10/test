.SH NAME
.B t_bind
\- bind to a transport endpoint
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_bind(int " fd ", struct t_bind *" req ", struct t_bind *" ret );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint to bind.
.TP
.I req
a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure containing the address to which the transport endpoint is requested
to be bound.
.TP
.I ret
a pointer to a
.B t_bind
structure returning the address to which the transport endpoint was actually
bound.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_bind ()
requests that the local transport endpoint,
.IR fd ,
be bound to the requested address and connection indication queue length,
.IR req ,
and return the resulting bound address and connection indication queue length,
.IR ret.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint to bind.
.I req
specifies the requested address and queue length.
.I ret
returns the resulting address and queue length.
.IR req " and " ret
are
.BR t_bind ()
structures formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_bind {
        struct netbuf addr;
        unsigned int qlen;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.TP
.I addr
A
.BR netbuf (3)
structure.
On call,
.I req->addr
specifies the address to bind.
If
.I req->addr.len
is zero, or
.I req
is
.BR NULL ,
it specifies that the transport service provider should assign, if
possible, a local transport endpoint address.
On return,
.I ret->addr
specifies the bound address.
.TP
.I qlen
The permitted number of outstanding connection indications that have been
delivered with
.BR t_listen (3)
but have not yet been accepted with
.BR t_accept (3)
or disconnected with
.BR t_snddis (3).
On call,
.I req->qlen
is the requested value.
If
.I req
is
.BR NULL ,
.I qlen
take on the value zero (0).
On return,
.I ret->qlen
is the transport provider assigned value.

Connectionless protocols do not support a non-zero
.IR qlen .
For connection oriented protocols,
when a non-zero
.I qlen
results from a call to
.BR t_bind (),
the endpoint
.I fd
can begin receiving connection indications that can be retrieved with
.BR t_listen (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
A call to
.BR t_bind ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_UNBND .
Upon success, the resulting state is
.BR T_IDLE .
.PP
If the resulting transport endpoint adress is the same as the provided
transport endpoint address, then it is permitted that
.I ret
not specify an address (i.e.
.I ret->addr.len
is set to zero).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_bind ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_bind ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_bind ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TACCES ]
The caller did not have sufficient permissions to use the address specified in
.IR req->addr .
.TP
.RB [ TADDRBUSY ]
The address specificed was already in use by another transport endpoint.
.TP
.RB [ TBADADDR ]
The address specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I ret->addr.maxlen
field of a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call was non-zero, but insufficient to hold the
available bound address information.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TNOADDR ]
No
.I req->addr
was specified
.IR "" ( req->addr.len " is zero)"
and the transport service
provider could not allocate an address.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
