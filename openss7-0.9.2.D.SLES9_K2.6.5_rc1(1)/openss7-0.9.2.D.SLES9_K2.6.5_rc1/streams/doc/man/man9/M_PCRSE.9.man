\- \fISTREAMS\fP priority reserved message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_PCRSE
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_PCRSE
message is a high priority message that consists of one
.B M_PCRSE
message block followed by an unspecified number of message blocks of unspecified type.

.SH INTERFACE

.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_PCRSE
message is a high priority message reserved for internal use by driver and module writers.
.PP
The message format is one
.B M_PCRSE
message block followed by an unspecified number of message blocks of unspecified type.  The precise
form of the message must be determined according to the internal use of the message.
.PP
When the
Stream head
receives an
.B M_PCRSE
message, it discards it.
.\"
.B M_PCRSE
message cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_PCRSE
messages arriving at the
Stream head
will be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_PCRSE
messages can be generated and consumed by drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
In general, an
.B M_PCRSE
message should not be used where an
.B M_PCCTL (9)
message will do (except for the purpose of portability).
.B M_PCRSE
is not really intended for inter-module communication but for cases where a specialized,
non-portable communication facility is required.  This message can also be used to distinguish
messages that a driver or module places on its own queues (e.g, when passing messages across a
multiplexing driver).
.PP
Nevertheless, to support the passing of
.B M_PCRSE
message between modules, or between driver and module, when necessary and appropriate, the following
guidelines should be followed by drivers and modules with regard to the
.B M_PCRSE
message:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not recognize an
.B M_PCRSE
message must pass the message along in the same manner as any high priority messages.  That
is, they are not subject to flow control and should not be queued.
.IP \(bu
A driver that does not recognize an
.B M_PCRSE
message, discards the message.
.IP \(bu
A driver or module processing an
.B M_PCRSE
message does so with regard is own internal definition.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_PCRSE
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
