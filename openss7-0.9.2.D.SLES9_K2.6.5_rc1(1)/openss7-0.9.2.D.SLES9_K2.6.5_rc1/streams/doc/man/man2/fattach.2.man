\- name a \fISTREAMS\fR special file
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <stropts.h>
.HP
.BI "int fattach(int " fd ", const char *" path );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the file descriptor to attach to a path.
.TP
.I path
the filesystem path to which to attach the file descriptor.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B fattach
attaches the open
.I STREAMS
special device file described by the file descriptor
.I fd
to the filesystem path specified by
.IR path .
All file operations on file descriptors subsequently opened on
.IR path
will operate on the attached
.I STREAMS
special device file instead of the file or directory that origianally corresponded to
.IR path .
This continues until the
.I STREAMS
special device file is detached from
.I path
using the
.BR fdetach (3)
utility.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR fattach ()
will return zero (0).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR fattach ()
will return -1 and set
.I errno
as described under
.RB \(lq ERRORS \(rq,
below.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ EACCES ]
Write access to the file specified by
.I path
is not allowed, or one of the directories in
.I path
did not allow search (execute) permission.
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
The file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The file specified by
.I path
is currently a mount point or already has a
.I STREAMS
special file attached to it.
.TP
.RB [ ELOOP ]
Too many symbolic links were encountered resolving
.IR path .
.TP
.RB [ ENAMETOOLONG ]
.I path
was too long or a resolved symbolic link contained a pathname that was too
long.
.TP
.RB [ ENOENT ]
A directory component in
.I path
does not exists or is a dangling symbolic link.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTDIR ]
A component used as a directory in
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
The effective user ID of the process is not the owner of the file specified by
.I path
and the process does not have appropriate privileges.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.I fd
does not refer to a
.I STREAMS
special file.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.SS Multi-Threading
.PP
.BR fattach ()
is thread-safe; however, performing
.BR fattach ()
on a filesystem path will affect other processes or thread using that path.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR fattach ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR fattach ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
including
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR LiS ,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR fattach ()
can be performed on any file to which the caller has ownership, write
permission and sufficient privilege to execute
.BR fattach ().
.IP \(em
Under
.BR LiS ,
root privilege or
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
is required.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
does not have this restriction.
.IP \(em
.BR fattach ()
makes no additional limitation on the number of
.I STREAMS
files that are attached.
.IP \(em
Under
.BR LiS ,
.BR fattach ()
limits number of
.I STREAMS
files attached to less than 256, because that is the maximum number of unnamed
devices allowed by
.BR mount (2).
The same is true for
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
provide a system call for
.I __NR_fattach
that is used to implement this system call.  (glibc has prototypes for this system call.)
In addition,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
recognizes the
.B I_LIS_FATTACH
.BR streamio (7)
input-output control used by LiS to emulate the
.I __NR_fattach
system call, permitting LiS libraries to be used with
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
