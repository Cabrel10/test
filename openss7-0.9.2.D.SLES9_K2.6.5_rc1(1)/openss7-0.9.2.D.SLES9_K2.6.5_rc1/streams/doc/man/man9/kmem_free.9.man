.SH NAME

\- deallocates kernel memory
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/kmem.h>
.HP
.BI "void kmem_free(char *" ptr ", size_t " size ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to the kernel memory area.
.PD 0
.TP
.I size
the size of the kernel memory area to free.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR DDI/DKI .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Deallocates the memory previously allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
must be called with a pointer,
.IR ptr ,
that was returned by a call to
.BR kmem_alloc "(9) or " kmem_zalloc (9),
and the same size,
.IR size ,
that was passed in the corresponding call to
.BR kmem_alloc "(9) or " kmem_zalloc (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If
.BR kmem_free ()
fails, it fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
As a side-effect of freeing memory allocated with
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
or
.BR kmem_zalloc (9),
.BR kmem_free ()
also causes outstanding buffer calls to be scheduled.
.BR kmem_free ()
checks the
.I strbcwait
system flag to see if there are buffer calls waiting.  If the
.I strbcwait
flag is set,
.BR kmem_free ()
sets the
.I strbcalls
flag to tell the
.I STREAMS
scheduler to run buffer callbacks on the next run of
.BR runqueues (9)
and sets the
.I qrunflag
to indicate to the system that
.BR runqueues (9)
should be executed as soon as possible.
This is consistent with the procedure described for
.BR kmem_free (9)
under
.IR "SVR 4" .

.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is implemented as a function that calls
.BR kfree (9)
or
.BR free_pages (9)
but which also performs the
.I STREAMS
scheduler related functions described above.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR kmem_alloc (9),
.BR kmem_zalloc (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR kmem_free ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[

.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
.[

with the following portability considerations:

however, they do not describe behaviour of buffer calls under
.IR STREAMS .
.IP \(em
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR kmem_free ()
ignores the
.I size
argument when freeing memory.
.I LiS
does not properly schedule buffer calls in accordance with
.IR "SVR 4.2" .
.IP \(em
.BR kmem_free ()
is implemented as a function call.
.I LiS
implements
.BR kmem_free ()
as a macro.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
