.SH NAME
.B t_sndreldata
\- send orderly release with data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sndreldata(int " fd ", struct t_discon *" discon );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint to release in an orderly fashion with data.
.TP
.I discon
a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure containing release data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_sndreldata ()
requests that the transport connection associated with local transport
endpoint
.I fd
be orderly released with user data.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint from which to send the orderly release
with user data.
.PP
.I discon
is a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure that describes the user data and reason for release.
The
.B t_discon
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_discon {
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int reason;                     /* reason code */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
The
.B t_discon
structure specifies the following members and information:
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that specifies the user data to include in the orderly release.
The
.I discon->udata.len
is significant on call.
If
.I discon->udata.len
is zero, no user data will be included in the orderly release.
.TP
.I reason
release reason values are transport service provider specific.
.TP
.I sequence
not used by
.BR t_sndreldata ()
and is left unchanged by the call.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sndreldata ()
is only valid in states
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_INREL .
In state
.BR T_DATAXFER ,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
initiates an orderly release with user data.
In state
.BR T_INREL ,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
completes an orderly release with user data.
.PP
.BR t_sndreldata ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.B T_COTS_ORD
and where the
.B T_ORDRELDATA
flag is returned in the provider flags field of the
.B t_info
structure returned by
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR t_getinfo (3).
.PP
In syncronous mode,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
blocks until there is sufficient room to buffer the message for transmission
considering flow control.  In asynchronous mode where there is insufficient
room to buffer the orderly release request with user data considering flow
control,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_sndreldata ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sndreldata ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).
This happens when the
.I discon
field of the
.B t_info
structure returned by
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR t_getinfo (3)
is
.BR T_INVALID ,
or is less than the amount of
.I udata
provided.
See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control and
.I fd
is set for asynchronous operation
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set using
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcntl (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can occur when the transport service provider service type is
.BR T_CLTS " or " T_COTS .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
