.SH NAME
.B getq, lis_getq
\- gets a message from a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "mblk_t *getq(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue from which to get a message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getq ()
retrieves a message from the specified queue,
.I q
and returns a pointer to that message to the caller.  If there are no message on
the specified queue,
.IR q ,
.BR getq ()
returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.PP
When
.BR getq ()
retrieves a message from the queue, it checks whether the low water mark has
been acheived.  If the low water mark has been crossed and the backward queue needs
back-enabling,
.BR getq ()
performs the necessary back-enabling by scheduling queue service routine
backwards up the queue chain.
.PP
When
.BR getq ()
returns
.B NULL
(the queue,
.IR q ,
is empty),
.BR getq ()
sets the
.B QWANTR
flag for the queue and performs back-enabling.
The
.B QWANTR
flag indicates to the streams scheduler that back-enabling has already been
performed for the empty queue and subsequent calls to
.BR getq ()
for the same empty queue will not generate another back-enable.
.PP
.BR getq ()
is normally called from within a queue service routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR getq ()
returns a pointer to the message which has been removed from the queue,
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR getq ()
returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the queue specified by
.I q
is empty,
.BR getq ()
returns a
.B NULL
pointer.
If the
.B QWANTR
flag is not already set for the queue,
.BR getq ()
will set the
.B QWANTR
flag and back-enable the stream.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
returns a
.B NULL
pointer when the queue specified by
.I q
is
.B NULL
or the structure pointed to by
.I q
is not a queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR getq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR getq ()
is intended to be MP-safe; however, the implementation in
.I LiS 2.18.1
of backenabling contains multiple race conditions that can result in loss of
synchronization of the queue,
.IR q ,
flags.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR putq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR getq ()
executed by one thread while another thread has the stream and queue frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
should cause the thread calling
.BR getq ()
to spin or block until the stream is thawed with
.BR unfreezestr (9).
This is not the case for
.IR LiS .
.[
LiS
.]
.PP
.BR getq ()
has multiple races in recent
.I LiS
implementation: an attempt at reducing lock contention by releasing write locks
on the queue,
.IR q ,
and reacquiring read locks on the same queue results in breaching the atomicity
of operations performed during backenabling.
This makes
.BR getq ()
largely unusable
for MP
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules on premptive or multiprocessor Linux kernels.
The only partial solution to this is to make all
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules of at least per-queue synchronization.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getq ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR getq ()
passed a
.B NULL
or invalid queue pointer,
.IR q ,
will have undefined results.
Under
.IR LiS ,
an
.B NULL
.I q
pointer will return
.B NULL
(but an invalid queue pointer can still have undefined results because
.I LiS
mistakenly locks the queue before testing the validity of the queue pointer).
As most service procedures pass
.BR getq ()
the queue pointer passed to the service procedure, these corner cases should
rarely be encountered.
.IP \(em
.BR getq ()
will retrieve messages from a queue that has had
.BR qprocsoff (9)
called or which is closing
.RB ( qclose (9)
has been called).
Under
.IR LiS ,
.BR getq ()
will return
.B NULL
in these cases.
.I LiS
behavior is incorrect for these cases.
.BR qprocsoff (9)
only effects the running of queue procedures and should not affect
.BR getq ().
.BR qclose (9)
may need to exchange messages with lower level queue pairs and making
.BR getq ()
return
.B NULL
during close is an
.I LiS
bug.
.IP \(em
.BR getq ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR getq ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR getq ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.PP
For a fully functional
.I STREAMS
implementation, use
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
