the file descriptor of a Stream connected to a multiplexing driver.

is the integer file descriptor of the Stream to link.

.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B I_LINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command links one Stream, with file descriptor
.IR arg ,
under the multiplexing driver of another Stream, with file descriptor
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
is the file descriptor of a Stream connected to a multiplexing driver, that was returned from the
.BR open (2s)
system call when the multiplexing driver was opened and the Stream created.  A multiplexing driver
is a
.I STREAMS
driver that has a lower multiplexer definition.  A lower multiplexer definition exists when the
.I st_muxrinit
and
.I st_muxwinit
members of the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure defining the driver are
.RB non- NULL .
.PP
.I arg
is the file descriptor of another Stream, that was returned from the
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR pipe (2s)
system call when the Stream was created.
In general, the Stream specified by
.I arg
can be any regular Stream,
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4),
or
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR fifo (4),
but
.I arg
must be associated with a Stream.
.PP
.B I_LINK
performs a regular link of the Stream, specified by
.IR arg ,
beneath the Stream specified by
.IR fd .
Regular links are automatically dismantled whenever the control Stream,
.IR fd ,
is closed or the last reference to the Stream is otherwise relinquished.
Regular links can also be explicitly removed with a call to
.BR I_UNLINK (7).
.PP
The
.B I_LINK
operation will cause the Stream head to generate a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message with a
.BR M_DATA (9)
block containing a
.BR linkblk (9)
structure.  This
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message is passed downstream to the multiplexing driver.  A positive
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
or negative
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
acknowledgement is expected from the driver before the operation can complete.
.PP
The
.B I_LINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
call will block waiting to acquire exclusive access to the Streams associated with
.I fd
and
.IR arg ,
awaiting allocation of the necessary internal
.I STREAMS
.BR linkblk (9)
and
.BR syncq (9)
data structures,
awaiting the allocation of an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message to pass downstream,
and
awaiting an acknowledgement from the driver.
.PP
The
.B I_LINK
operation will fail if the call times out awaiting acknowledgement from the driver,
the call is interrupted by a signal,
or either the control Stream,
.IR fd ,
or the linked Stream,
.IR arg ,
receives a hangup
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
or an asynchronous error
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message before the call can complete.
.PP
When successful, the operation completes and a system-wide unique multiplex link indentifier is
returned.  This value can subsequently be used as an argument to an
.BR I_UNLINK (7)
operation, to unlink the linked Stream.
.PP
.I STREAMS
records the fact that this link is a regular link.  Even though the returned multiplex link identifier
is system-wide unique, a call to
.BR I_PUNLINK (7)
with a multiplex identifier returned from an
.I I_LINK
operation will fail and return
.RB [ EINVAL ].
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B I_LINK
is used to form a regular link between a multiplexing driver and another Stream.  Regular links
are associated with a control Stream (specified by
.IR fd ).
When the control Stream is closed and the last reference to the Stream relinquished, all
regularly linked Streams associated with the control Stream are released.
.PP
It is not necessary to keep a regularly linked Stream open for it to remain linked under the
control Stream.  The file descriptor
.I arg
may be closed after it is linked under the driver and the Stream will remain linked.  When the
control Stream is closed, the Stream will be unlinked and the reference to the Stream released
causing the linked Stream to be dismantled.
.PP
The control Stream itself can later be linked underneath another multiplexing driver.  In this
manner, complex trees of multiplexed Streams can be created.  However, if regular links are used
throughout, the uppermost control Stream must remain open for the configuration to be maintained.
.PP
In contrast, the
.BR I_PLINK (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
causes a Stream to be persistently linked under a multiplexing driver.
.PP
Regular links are typically used by daemon processes.  When the daemon process starts, it forms
the multiplex, keeps the control Stream open, and sleeps waiting for an event or signal.  If the
daemon process should die or exit, the multiplex is dismantled.
.PP
In contrast, persistent links created with
.BR I_PLINK (7)
do not require the existence of a daemon process to maintain the multiplex.
See
.BR I_PLINK (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success, the
.B I_LINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns a positive integer.
Upon failure, the
.B I_LINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.PP
When successful,
.B I_LINK
returns a positive integer representing the multiplex identifier of the linked Stream.  This value
can subsequently be used in a
.BR I_UNLINK (7)
command.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS

.B I_LINK
.BR ioctl (2s)

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I "SVR 4.2 SPG"
.[
svr42spg
.]
indicates that
.I STREAMS
keeps track of linked Streams and detects when a loop could occur in a given multiplex arrangement,
and that
.RB [ EINVAL ]
can be returned when a possible looping configuration is detected.
.RS
.ll -7n
.PP
\(lqThe construction of cycles is not allowed when creating links.  A cycle could be constructued by
creating a persistent link of multiplexer 2 below multiplexer 1 and then closing the controlling
file descriptor associated with the multiplexer 2 and reopening it again and then linking the
multiplexer 1 below the multiplexer 2.  This is not allowed.  The operating system prevents a
multiplexer configuration from containing a cycle to ensure that messages cannot be routed
infinitely, thus creating an infinite loop or overflowing the kernel stack.\(rq
.[
svr42spg
.]
.ll +7n
.RE
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
does not detect such arrangements, because, for the most part, they can represent valid
configurations.  This is likely, however, a security issue, particularly if a looping arrangement
can be built by an unprivileged user.
.PP
Because persistent links typically require root privilege, this is not such an issue for persistent
links as it is for regular links.
