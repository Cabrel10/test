.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I first
a pointer to the first address from which to compare.

.TP
.I second
a pointer to the second address from which to compare.
.TP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
compares
.I len
bytes from the first address
.I first
to the second address
.IR second .
If
.I len
is zero, this function has no effect.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
If the two strings are equal,
.BR bcmp ()
returns 0, otherwise it returns a non-zero result.
If the size,
.IR len ,
is zero, the two strings are assumed to be equal and
.BR bcmp ()
returns 0.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
is MP-safe, provided the caller ensures exclusive access to the memory areas involved.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
preserves this deprecated function.
.BR memcmp (9)
should be used instead.
For older
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules, it is sufficient to define the macro:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2
#define bcmp(first, second, len) (int)memcmp(second, first, len)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR bcopy (9),
.BR bzero (9),
.BR memcpy (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR bcmp ()
is deprecated, use

instead.
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR mi_bcmp ()
is provided for compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
and systems based on
.IR MPS \(rg.
.BR mi_bcmp ()
simply calls
.BR bcmp ()
directly.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
.BR bcmp ()
first appeared in
.BR 4.1BSD .
Its use in
.I STREAMS
drivers is probably testimony to the fact that Dennis Ritchie implemented the first
.I Stream I/O System
on
.BR 4.1BSD .
.BR mi_bcmp ()
first appeared in
.IR OSF/1 .
