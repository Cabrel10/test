##
## Driver specifications
##
## multiple major numbers for a driver may be allocated two ways:
## . by explicitly requesting n-majors (see below)
## . by requesting an n-minors value large enough to require more than
##   one major number.
##
## strconf now supports allocating multiple major numbers, but
## not all drivers do.  It is only known to work for 'fifo' at this time.
##
##	name		prefix		major	n-minors  n-majors
driver	clns		clns_		*
#driver	tp		tp_		*
#driver	x25-lapb	lapb_		*
#driver	x25-plp		plp_		*

##
## Object name specifications
##
##	type	name		object name
objname	driver	clns		clns
#objname	driver	tp		tp
#objname	driver	x25-lapb	x25-lapb
#objname	driver	x25-plp		x25-plp

##
## Loadable specifications
##
## If you do not have a system with support for demand-loading modules
## into the kernel, you will have to load these modules by hand or in
## the startup scripts.
## If you do not use the loadable keyword at all, everything is linked
## into streams.o.
##
loadable    clns
#loadable    tp
#loadable    x25-lapb
#loadable    x25-plp

##
## Node specifications
##
## Loop driver now makes its own nodes in its init routine as an 
## example of how to use lis_mknod.
##
##	name	          type	perm	major		minor
node	/dev/clns	    c	0666	clns		0
#node	/dev/tp		    c	0666	230		tp
#node	/dev/tp0	    c	0666	tp		1
#node	/dev/tp1	    c	0666	tp		2
#node	/dev/tp2	    c	0666	tp		3
