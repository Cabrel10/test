.B strioctl
\- \fISTREAMS\fR I/O control data structure
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The
.B strioctl
structure is formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct strioctl {
        int ic_cmd;           /* command to perform */
        int ic_timout;        /* ioctl timeout period */
        int ic_len;           /* size of data buffer */
        char *ic_dp;          /* addr of data buffer */
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B strioctl
structure contains the following members:
.TP \w'ic_timout\(em'u
.I ic_cmd
the
.BR ioctl (2s)
command to issue.
.TP
.I ic_timout
the timeout interval to wait for an acknowledgement from the driver, in seconds, zero for
default, or
.B INFTIM
for an infinite wait.
.TP
.I ic_len
the number of bytes of user data in the area pointed to by
.I ic_dp
that is to be passed with the command.
.TP
.I ic_dp
a pointer to the bytes of user data to be passed with the command.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strioctl
structure is used in a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR I_STR (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
call as described in
.BR streamio (7).
.PP
Declarations for the
.B strioctl
structure are exposed by including the
.RB <sys/stropts.h>
system header file.  On some systems the declarations can be exposed by including the
.RB <stropts.h>
system header file.
.PP
Because it is passed in a system call, the
.B strioctl
structure is defined for both user space programs as well as kernel resident
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers, but, in particular, it is defined within the
.IR "Stream head" .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The program issuing an
.BR I_STR (7)
command using the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call, passes a pointer to a
.B strioctl
structure as the
.I arg
argument of the command to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
call.
.PP
The
.BR I_STR (7)
command results in the issuing of a
.IR STREAMS -based
input-output control command with value
.I ic_cmd
being issued to the
.I STREAMS
driver.
.PP
The call will block awaiting the receipt of an acknowledgement message from the driver, or until
the timeout specified by
.I ic_timout
has elapsed.
.I ic_timout
can be a specified number of seconds, the value zero, or the constant value
.BR INFTIM .
.PP
When set to zero,
.I ic_timout
specifies that the system default timeout for
.IR STREAMS -based
input-output controls should be used.  The default timeout is typically
15 seconds, and can be controllled with the
.B sys.streams.ioctimeout
system control, as described in
.BR sysctl (2).
.PP
When set to
.BR INFTIM ,
the call will block for an indefinite period of time awaiting an acknowledgement.
.PP
Data associated with the input-output control command can be passed with the call.  When there is no
user data to pass, the
.I ic_len
value will be set to zero.
When there is user data to pass, the
.I ic_len
value will indicate the amount of data, starting at the address specified by
.IR ic_dp ,
that is to be passed with the call.
.PP
.BR I_STR (7)
input-output commands can also pass data to the user.  Any data passed to the user will be placed in
the data buffer beginning at the address specified by
.IR ic_dp .
The caller is responsible for ensuring that the buffer beginning at
.I ic_dp
has sufficient room to accept the amount of data that will be passed to the caller, based on the
particular
.I ic_cmd
command being issued.
