*                        LiS Module Header File                         *
*************************************************************************
*									*
* A STREAMS driver that is capable of being a separately loadable	*
* module can include this file at the very beginning.  This header file	*
* will sense the MODULE and MODVERSIONS kernel parameters and include	*
* the proper kernel header files in the proper order.			*
* 									*
* There is a difference between 2.4 and 2.6 in this respect.  In 2.4	*
* the kernel defines "module_info", a standard STREAMS symbol.  If we	*
* include <sys/stream.h> BEFORE <linux/module.h> then the kernel's	*
* definition clashes with ours.						*
* 									*
* In 2.6 the kernel declares "dev_t" in such a way that it interferes	*
* with the LiS definition.  We need to define it away before including	*
* any kernel includes.							*
* 									*
* The bottom line is that the order of includes makes a difference	*
* depending upon whether it is a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel.  So this file exists*
* in order to make it easy for the driver write to get around this.	*
