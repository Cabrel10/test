the queue for which to set sizes and procedures.

a pointer to the

an integer that, when non-zero, indicates to use the lower multiplexer

.SH INTERFACE

.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR setsq ()
establishes synchronization queues and sets the queue parameters for the read and write queues of
the queue pair indicated by the read queue pointer,
.IR q ,
to the read and write side initialization information from the
.BR fmodsw (9)
structure,
.IR fmodsw ,
for the driver or module.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.BR setsq ()
first removes any current synchronization queues associated with queue,
.IR q .
When passed a
.B NULL
.I fmodsw
pointer and a
.RB non- NULL
.I q
pointer,
.BR setsq ()
will simply remove any synchronization queues currently attached to the queue,
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR setsq ()
returns zero (0) and sets the appropriate synchornization queues, sizes and procedures.  Upon
failure,
.BR setsq ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR setsq ()
fails, it returns a negative error number.
.BR setsq ()
can fail under the following conditions:
.TP \w'[\fBENOMEM\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
Normally
.BR setsq ()
will block awaiting the availability of kernel memory for the allocation of synchronization queue,
.BR syncq (9),
structures; however, under exceptional circumstances that allocation might fail.  In that event,
.BR setsq ()
fails and returns negative
.RB [ ENOMEM ].
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR setsq ()
can be called from any blocking context, including user context,
.IR qi_qopen (9)
or
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures, and
some uppermost
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR setsq ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access
to the queue pair.  A reference on both the
.BR queue (9)
and
.BR fmodsw (9)
structures should be held across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR setsq ()
is used internally by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler when creating a new queue pair for a driver or module to set the synchronization queues
and parameters associated with each queue in the queue pair from the driver or module
.BR streamtab .
It is also used by the
.I STREAMS
stream head when linking streams under a multiplexing driver to set the lower multiplexer queue
parameters against the stream head queue pair.
.PP
.BR setsq ()
calls
.BR setq (9)
internally.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH BUGS

has no known bugs.
