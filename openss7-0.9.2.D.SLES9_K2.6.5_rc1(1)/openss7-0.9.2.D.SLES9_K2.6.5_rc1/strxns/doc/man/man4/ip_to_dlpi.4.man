.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ip_to_dlpi
is a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing pseudo-device driver.  It accepts DLPI streams (of a particular
character) linked beneath it and presents ethernet interfaces named
\(lq\\0IP2X0,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X1,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X2,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X3,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X4,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X5,\(rq
\(lq\\0IP2X6,\(rq
and
\(lq\\0IP2X7\(rq
to the Linux TCP/IP system.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B ip_to_dlpi
is similar in many respects to
.BR ip_strms_mod (4),
however, that implementation is a
.IR STREAMS (4)
module, while this implementation is a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
The major weakness of this implementation might be that the
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing pseudo-device driver might not be capable of all the features of
DLPI, but, rather, is tailored to a specific X.25 implementation.
