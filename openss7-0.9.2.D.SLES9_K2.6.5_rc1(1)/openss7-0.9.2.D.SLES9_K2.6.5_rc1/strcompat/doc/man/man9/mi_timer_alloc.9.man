.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue upon which to ultimately place the timer message.
.TP
.I size
the size of the user portion of the timer message.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR MacOT \(rg
supplies robust timer services that are synchronized with the
.I STREAMS
environment.  Timer services are supported by using special
.I STREAMS
messages.  The function
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is used to create one of these special
.I STREAMS
messages.
.PP
Calling
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
will create a
.I STREAMS
timer message of the requested size, that is targeted to the specified
.I STREAMS
queue.

.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
succeeds, it returns 
.BR true  " (1);
when it fails, it returns
.BR false " (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
fails when 
.\"

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
can be called from
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I STREAMS
message allocated has type
.BR M_PCSIG (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR mi_timer (9),
.BR mi_timer_cancel (9),
.BR mi_timer_free (9),
.BR mi_timer_valid (9),
.BR maccompat (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.

.SH HISTORY

.BR mi_timer_alloc ()
first appeared in

is probably a Mentat, Inc. function that goes all the way back to the

implementations.
