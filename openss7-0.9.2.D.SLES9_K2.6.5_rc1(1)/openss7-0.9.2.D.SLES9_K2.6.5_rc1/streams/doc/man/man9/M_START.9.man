.SH NAME
.B M_START
\- \fISTREAMS\fP start output message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_START
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_START
message is a high priority message that consists of a single
.B M_START
message block.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_START
message tells a device to start its output.
.B M_START
and
.BR M_STOP (9)
are intended to produce momentary pauses in a device's output, not to turn devices on or off.
.PP
The message format is not defined by
.I STREAMS
and its use is developer dependent.  The
.B M_START
and
.BR M_STOP (9)
messages may be considered a special case of an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message.
The use and format of the
.B M_START
message forms part of a service interface definition.
.\"
.PP
.B M_START
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_START
messages arriving at the
Stream head
will be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_START
messages can be generated and consumed by drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR ldterm (4)
and
.IR STREAMS -based
terminals and pseudo-terminals send this message downstream to start output of a half-duplex
terminal device.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
See
.BR ldterm (4).
.\"
.\"

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_START
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B M_START

Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
